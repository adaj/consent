G,Who can create google docs?,ELI,P,SE1 11.10,
H,"I can create, I'm trying to explore it they can link it from Teams beacause there's is a cloud storage so I can add a folder.",QC,P,SE1 11.10,
G,Mhm,QC,P,SE1 11.10,
H,Let me just try it out. Have you discussed about the topic yet?,ELI,P,SE1 11.10,
G,No,CON,,SE1 11.10,
K,No,CON,,SE1 11.10,
G,We just…waited for you,EXT,,SE1 11.10,
H,Ohh sorry! (laughing) Okay.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
G,And trying to figure out the problems in Teams…um…,EXT,,SE1 11.10,
H,So we want to start talking about that first then we'll sort out the google document later?,ELI,F,SE1 11.10,
K,Sounds great.,QC,F,SE1 11.10,
A,Yeah.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
H,"Okay, so I think we had a couple of ideas, right?",INT,P,SE1 11.10,
G,Yes. I can start for example.,QC,P,SE1 11.10,
H,Okay sure!,QC,P,SE1 11.10,
G,And share my screen. I have already put in our channel two documents. Sorry they are with my remarks,EXT,P,SE1 11.10,
K,(smiling) No worries.,EXT,,SE1 11.10,
G,And this is general foundation of emotion regulation. I think we can start just reading this because it's very comprehensive overview of,EXT,F,SE1 11.10,
H,Emotion,EXT,,SE1 11.10,
G,"Yes about emotion, and emotion... Briefly, it's a part of our affect. And emotion, uh, this after created a model...a model that they have some situation, attention, appraisal and response regarding emotion. And we have five processes where we can regulate our emotions, situation selection, situation modification, attention deployment, cognitive change and modulation.",EXT,,SE1 11.10,
K,"Yeah, this was also a part of the readings and the videos.",INT,R,SE1 11.10,
G,Yes yes yes! Lecturer I think she took this information and incorporated in their article.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
K,Yeah,QC,,SE1 11.10,
G,"Yeah, but this is foundation, I think.",CON,,SE1 11.10,
K,Mhm.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
H,The theoretical framework?,ELI,,SE1 11.10,
G,"Yes, theoretical framework. Um, and just about emotion
regulation and my second article. I start to thought about some tools, computer tool that can recognize and recognize yes face, facial emotion.",EXT,,SE1 11.10,
H,Ok.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
K,Mmm.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
G,And maybe we can start thinking this…,ELI,F,SE1 11.10,
H,Mmm (overlaps)…,QC,,SE1 11.10,
G,(continues) … direction ,ELI,,SE1 11.10,
H,"So they used, am, this technology to help, am, like recognize emotions and how does it link to the regulation?",ELI,,SE1 11.10,
G,"No, for example, if we now talk with each other with open camera, maybe some problem af, some program can, I don't know, make sound like deep…",CON,,SE1 11.10,
H,It must know your signal that you are angry or something. (smiles),EXT,,SE1 11.10,
G,"Yes, yes you're happy now or not, your friend…",QC,,SE1 11.10,
H,"(Overlaps) Haha, I am happy ",QC,,SE1 11.10,
G,"Some, I do not know…",EXT,,SE1 11.10,
H,"Ok,",QC,,SE1 11.10,
G,Kind of…signals,EXT,,SE1 11.10,
H,"Ok, ok, so you provide the feedback about how the other people are, could be feeling. ",ELI,,SE1 11.10,
G,"Yes, maybe it's a good for teachers as well.",QC,,SE1 11.10,
H,Ok.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
G,"For example, if during some lesson teachers can see some dashboards, or learning analytics graphic, which, for example, all classes are boring or not, only interest something like that.",EXT,,SE1 11.10,
K,"Yeah, yeah.",QC,,SE1 11.10,
A,"I guess, like, Teams already kind of has the beginning of that, because, like, now in a class you can, like, click on the little emoji thing, or like yeah, even here in zoom, like, I can do a reaction like.",INT,,SE1 11.10,
G,"Yes, but it's your, how to say, it's your choice.",CON,,SE1 11.10,
A,"Yeah, yeah, exactly. (overlaps)",QC,,SE1 11.10,
G,"You can understand, but here, as I understand, the program can read your face.",CON,,SE1 11.10,
A,Mmm.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
K,Ok.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
H,"Yeah, I think that program can detect if this person is really happy, unhappy, sad, suprised.",QC,,SE1 11.10,
G,Mhm,QC,,SE1 11.10,
H,OK.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
K,It sounds quite new. Or is it? From which date is it? Which year is this study conducted?,ELI,,SE1 11.10,
G,"Am, fo- four hours, four years ago. ",EXT,,SE1 11.10,

G,"2017, as I see.",EXT,,SE1 11.10,
A,Mm.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
K,Mhm.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
H,Ok.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
G,How can I zoom?,ELI,,SE1 11.10,
K,"And with these, am, technology you could like, am, draw some patterns, for example? So, I mean everybody has a role in, in, in a group and then maybe the one who is the leader of the group maybe, has some specific emotion, I don't know. This could be quite interesting. If you follow this.",EXT,,SE1 11.10,
G,Mhm.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
K,Do you know what I mean?,ELI,,SE1 11.10,
A,Khm. (coughs),QC,,SE1 11.10,
G,"Yes, I…",QC,,SE1 11.10,
H,Profiling different people’s emotions and their roles.,EXT,,SE1 11.10,
K,"And the roles, connected to their roles, yeah.",INT,,SE1 11.10,
H,"Mhm, ok.",QC,,SE1 11.10,
G,"So, stop sharing, this is my small preparation, ah (exhale).",EXT,P,SE1 11.10,
H,Maybe that's something we can work from.,ELI,P,SE1 11.10,
K,"Definitely, yeah. ",QC,P,SE1 11.10,
A,"I also liked the suggestion for, am, just the intercultural setting. I didn't really… I kind of just browsed, am, for some papers but, or articles, but I took a class last semester. It was kind of just one of these small seminar things about intercultural learning and I think there's definitely, aaa, it offers a wide variety. Am, but for example, like, am, there was one article I saw, that was about technology enhanced intercultural learning. But I I again I haven't really read through it, but I can maybe put it in the teams.",EXT,,SE1 11.10,
G,Mhm.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
A,"Am, but I, I, I liked that topic a bit more, but again, I'm pretty open, hmhm (smiles). ",CON,,SE1 11.10,
H,"Oh, what is the title of the paper again?",ELI,,SE1 11.10,
A,"This one is Culture and the development of conflict resolution style by Spencer Kagan, here, I’ll... (looks like putting the article in teams)",EXT,,SE1 11.10,
H,"So this is about conflict reg-, conflict resolution?",ELI,,SE1 11.10,
A,Yeah.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
H,"In the, in, in the cultural context or just general?",ELI,,SE1 11.10,
A,"Am, In the cultural context, I believe, I'll, I'll upload this part.",QC,F,SE1 11.10,
H,"Okay, interesting. ",QC,F,SE1 11.10,
A,Khm (Coughs). One second.,EXT,,SE1 11.10,
K,"Sounds also interesting. Hmhm (smiles, everybody smiles pleasantly). Am, I also had a look on some papers and I came across a paper which title is The comparison between good and poor collaborators… (overlaps) ",EXT,P,SE1 11.10,
H,"Ah, ok. ",QC,P,SE1 11.10,
G,(Continues) and how they are different with their emotional regulation.,EXT,,SE1 11.10,
H,Aaa.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
K,"Am, that's what I found quite interesting, but I'm open for every topic. Hmhm (everybody smiles pleasantly).",EXT,F,SE1 11.10,
H,"(Smiles) Yeah, I think I came across the top-, that that topic too, but I  didn't go in and read up on that… Aaa, yeah, so initially I… (Interrupts to check with P2) You're finished sharing your thoughts, hm?",ELI,,SE1 11.10,
K,"Yeah, it was just a quick note. (smiles as well)",QC,,SE1 11.10,
H,"Yeah, like I,I, I was looking at intercultural but I think I was trying to find intercultural and then CSCL and, aaa, emotional regulation. And I found that like it was a bit hard to find like articles particularly, like, on this 3 aspects. But maybe, if it's just intercultural and conflict resolution, maybe there are.",EXT,,SE1 11.10,
A,Mhm.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
H,"Yeah, so yeah, that was what I realized about the intercultural. I think it was a bit hard. I forgot to ask Essi just now about the article that they published on intercultural. But maybe I can ask her later.",EXT,,SE1 11.10,
G,Mhm.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
H,"Am, what I found, one that was interesting, was like, they had a few, there was involving scripting, so it was the use of scripting tools to facilitate emotional regulation.",EXT,,SE1 11.10,
K,Mhm.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
H,So they got… Maybe I can show you what the article… (overlaps),EXT,P,SE1 11.10,
G,Mhm.,QC,P,SE1 11.10,
H,"(Continues) So, they had a program that got students to, like,  they have to write something like a mini reflection. Let me share. Ok. The host has disabled screen sharing. (externalizing) I think you have to share the host with me or something.",EXT,P,SE1 11.10,
G,"Sorry, Sorry, yes, just a moment. Now you, co-host.",EXT,P,SE1 11.10,
H,"Ok, so yeah. So they had like, a system where like, students would fill in, like… Can I make it bigger (to herself)?",EXT,P,SE1 11.10,
G,Mhm.,QC,P,SE1 11.10,
H,"(inaudible) bigger. Yeah, so they all feel like, when I think about something like, working with my group, I am like, they have to feel their feelings like, and why and then like, how, how can they, like what better, what he they should do. (showing on a tool they need to feel out). So with this kind of (inaudible) they were analyzing how this is, this might help with their emotional regulation in the group. But it's I think it's more than just emotional regulation, it also involves the metacognition aspect. I thought this was quite interesting, they helped them…. Like, the script there helped to structure their thoughts and their emotions. Yeah (overlaps)… ",EXT,P,SE1 11.10,
G,"Yeah, but this is, this is not about culture, yes? Yeah, this is just… (overlaps)",ELI,,SE1 11.10,
H,"Yeah, yeah, this is not cultural, yeah, this is just, how scripting can help to facilitate emotional regulation.  
But this is one. Yeah, then the intercultural like communication is also another aspect, we can look at. Or we can also look at…what was this?",QC,,SE1 11.10,
G,"And this is, as I see, it's also it's computer supported, yes?",ELI,,SE1 11.10,
H,Yes.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
G,Technology…?,ELI,,SE1 11.10,
H,"Yes, yes, this is so, yes, this involves a, this is a cross towards scripting.",QC,,SE1 11.10,
G,Mhm.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
H,It's a combination of how scripting can be used.,EXT,,SE1 11.10,
A,Mhm.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
H,"Yeah, to enhance regulation in, weather is it cognitive regulation or emotional regulation. I thought the system was quite interesting.",EXT,,SE1 11.10,
G,Mhm.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
H,"They had to analyze, like, write down their reflections. And then this, this, there were prompts to reflect on the collaboration.",EXT,,SE1 11.10,
G,Mhm.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
H,"Yeah, so this was one aspect. Uh, I think, another one that I happened to look at, was like… Uh, there were a few articles that look at motivate - , like what motivates students to regulate their emotions.",EXT,,SE1 11.10,
G,Mhm.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
H,"Yeah, but I let me see whether it works. No, ok… Maybe it will work. Oh, who is this man?",EXT,,SE1 11.10,

G,Mhm (interrupts).,QC,,SE1 11.10,

G,"Hm, (laughs) I think all, all topics focus on emotion regulation, because what we can do with emotion, just regulate, hmhm (laughs).",INT,,SE1 11.10,
H,"Yeah (small break). Yeah, yeah, so yeah.",QC,,SE1 11.10,
H,"Yeah, so yeah or we can look at what factors lead to successful emotional regulation. I don't know. Yeah… ",CON,P,SE1 11.10,
K,"Yeah, I think we have to narrow it down (overlaps).",CON,P,SE1 11.10,
H,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.10,

G,"it's so complicated (nodding yes) and not so much articles, yes?",ELI,,SE1 11.10,
A,Yeah.,QC,,SE1 11.10,
H,"Yeah, I think there's, there's no… There is very little article that are  specifically on, like, emotions in CSCL. They tend to mix it a bit. ",INT,,SE1 11.10,

H,"Okay. Then we can just put it in teams, maybe we can put it under the files section?",ELI,F,SE1 11.10,
A,Mhm,QC,F,SE1 11.10,
G,I have one question. Why we decide to go to the Google Docs?,ELI,F,SE1 11.10,
K,To write our article. That's why we decided to go to Google Docs.,EXT,F,SE1 11.10,
G,Because we have a note or Word in Teams.,ELI,F,SE1 11.10,

K,Yeah it is. And I mean…,QC,F,SE1 11.15,
G,Go ahead! Go ahead!,EXT,F,SE1 11.15,
K,The overall topic we already decided on and then we decided to just look for some articles that we can use for our for our research or for our article and maybe we can present them and then we can define the aim afterwards. What do we think abut this?,ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
H,"Yeah, yes we can do it that way.",QC,F,SE1 11.15,
G,Uh-huh,QC,F,SE1 11.15,
K,"So I'm not sure if you saw, but I created on folder with the articles, so I found two articles. Uh one of these articles is about emotion regulation, uh, emotion and motivation regulation in a science class. 
And the proposal, a few different tools that they used, ah yeah, I think this was... this one, yeah. And so they used like We Spot. This is like an a tool for for questionnaire. Then they also used N study. Yeah, it was N study to support the regulation and also some electrodermal activity tools, and also they measured the heart rate of the students. 
That was quite interesting and then they put it all together and then the head like yeah some data which they could. 
Umm, yeah. I'm out of running out of words how they can interpret, um, the emotion regulation.",EXT,,SE1 11.15,
H,Yeah this one. They have this scaffording of…,QC,,SE1 11.15,
K,"Yeah, and this was an overall UM, environment in a Flipped Classroom.",INT,,SE1 11.15,
H,Okay.,QC,,SE1 11.15,
K,Does everybody know what Flipped Classroom is?,ELI,,SE1 11.15,
G,Yes.,QC,,SE1 11.15,
K,"Okay cool. And this is just a short summary and the other article was more for promoting the awareness of individual social Uh, emotional regulation and the social shared, emotional regulation, and, uh, they used the three tools like the like, a radar tool, and then a plan tool and an evaluation tool. And then they put all these data together as well. But, uh, I think this is something different that we try to to to...research.",EXT,,SE1 11.15,
H,Okay slightly different from our research.,CON,,SE1 11.15,
K,"Yeah, it's just it's tools how you can. How do I say it…",QC,,SE1 11.15,
H,Or (inaudible) condition right?,ELI,,SE1 11.15,
K,Yeah yeah.,QC,,SE1 11.15,
H,That is socially shared regulation.,EXT,,SE1 11.15,
K,"Yeah. But this's not a tool that is like, UM Yeah, doesn't focus on like eye movement or something like this.",CON,,SE1 11.15,
H,"Yeah, I think I I read another one that's similar to this. I think it's by the same author.",INT,,SE1 11.15,
K,Ahh alright,QC,,SE1 11.15,
H,"Yeah I know I saw this too. But that one, okay….",QC,,SE1 11.15,
G,"I've read the first too. Uh, the first article in my previous year just year related to (inaudible) and multimodal measurement. ",INT,,SE1 11.15,
K,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 11.15,
G,"Yes, it was so interesting. Ah….can i continue?",ELI,,SE1 11.15,
H,"Yeah, I'll just off the shared screen.",QC,,SE1 11.15,
K,Yes sure!,QC,,SE1 11.15,
H,I think I saw your…okay.,EXT,,SE1 11.15,
G,I created some summaries of two articles. First article I presented to you last time… How can I do it? How can I Zoom? Can you see or should I?,ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
H,"Yes, it's at the bottom there is oh yeah.",QC,P,SE1 11.15,
G,"No, this is better. About a EMODA and just make briefly notes about resarch questions about theoretical and technological background.  Uh, they explore emotion and learning how it's connected, emotion recognition theories, 
discrete and dimensional, also mentioned about automatic emotion recognition, and they use these tools. These reader and Microsoft emotional service API.",EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
H,Okay,QC,,SE1 11.15,
K,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 11.15,
G,"Next, the context was the platform Speak Plus. Training learning languages. They use multimodal approach for data sources, audio, video, self report and interaction traces. 
Uh, they created these two a model. It's like dashboard with the visualization. And this is shortly their summary.",EXT,,SE1 11.15,
K,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 11.15,
G,"By applying both dimensional and discrete emotion models, we showed that we can detect different learners emotions during such settings. Sorry for my voice background",EXT,,SE1 11.15,
G,"With highlights the need for multimodal approach to emotion collection and recognition. Uh, we believe, uh, that providing tutors with an awareness tool to visualize and direct their learner's emotions will help them better maintain and sustainable social effective relationship as well as adjusting learning activity materials accordingly.
I just want to show you again the visualisation from this tool.",EXT,,SE1 11.15,
K,Uh-huh. Was this the article that you presented last time?,ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
G,Yes yes yes yes!,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,That's the one that can read your emotions right?,ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
G,Yes yes.,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,"Express emotion, ah okay.",QC,,SE1 11.15,
G,This is visualisation.,EXT,,SE1 11.15,
K,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 11.15,
G,"Like a dashboard, how students and teachers can see how emotions transfer to the code to to the electronic format, how they visualize, visualize, visualize. ",EXT,,SE1 11.15,
K,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 11.15,
G,And my second article this is from the same author from france.,EXT,,SE1 11.15,
K,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 11.15,
G,"Just a moment. The name your name is lovu, something like that. And she also present a emotion awareness tool to support emotion, but it's not a technological tools. However, I found this article like an initial starting point because in your study uh, she concludes that the student expressed mainly negative emotions in academic context.",CON,,SE1 11.15,
K,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 11.15,
G,"And they mainly related to individual or group learning experience rather than other students, so our students emotions focused more only our own emotions or situations, but not the other students or participants emotions.",EXT,,SE1 11.15,
H&K,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 11.15,
G,"And here I briefly, uh, posted their results and conclusions. It's not about technological, but it's in the context of academic studies.",EXT,,SE1 11.15,
K,So is this article also in the context of umm technological learning setting?,ELI,,SE1 11.15,
G,"I'm not sure it's not about technological, it's just about general emotion regulation in the academic context.",CON,,SE1 11.15,
K,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 11.15,
G,"Just general how students, uh, regulate their emotions.",CON,,SE1 11.15,
H,This is more of like a framework of how…,ELI,,SE1 11.15,
G,Yes yes yes yes!,QC,,SE1 11.15,
H,… understanding of like how this emotion factors maybe?,ELI,,SE1 11.15,
G,"Hmm, that's why maybe it's some kind of initial stage like a UM students, uh, express mainly negative emotion in in their studies. That's why we need to think about some tools or some approach that can help them to regulate their emotions in academic context.",EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
H,Okay.  (inaudible) stating the problem.,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
G,Yes.,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,"Okay. Uh, I I read let me just. So I read the one that K sends about, this one I think... I didn't write on the the summary, but they were just trying to explore like different tools that they can use for emotional regulation. So, uh, they start with some of the frameworks. This one looks like the framework that we have seen in the model. 
So yes, so this actually has a summary of the different tools that have been researched by I think, mainly by Järvenoja. Like some of the possible, some of the tools which were in the past studies.",EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
K,Uh-huh,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,Which maybe we can look into.,EXT,F,SE1 11.15,
K,Or look there was also the radar and our plan and our evaluated and I also meant in my in my previous studies that's funny.,CON,F,SE1 11.15,
H,Yeah.,QC,,SE1 11.15,
G,It's not about emotion yes? It's related to different aspect.,ELI,,SE1 11.15,
H,Yeah it's more of metacognition and yeah.,QC,,SE1 11.15,
G,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 11.15,
H,"Uh, I think the one on emotions were this one EmAtool. So this is the one for emotions that they're looking at as regulation. So this one UM EmA tool. So EmA tool is something similar to the one that just now. I think K shows…",EXT,,SE1 11.15,
G,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 11.15,
H,"...so you will choose how they are feeling, evaluate, explain and then their motivation. Yeah, this will this few points.",EXT,,SE1 11.15,
G,This is referred to self reporting I I think.,INT,,SE1 11.15,
H,"Yes. So, uh, yeah. So these were some of the limitations that they find like it's only used at the beginning…",INT,,SE1 11.15,
G,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 11.15,
H,...and then that's not cover all the goals….,INT,,SE1 11.15,
K,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 11.15,
H,"So, they had another one. OK, so they were trying to use it on uh, on in the context of this gymkhana activity, where, UM like students participate and work in groups to solve Like what problems. So then they were saying I think the back may not be so relevant, but they were saying how like yeah they were giving examples of how they were emotional conflict in terms of how like the leaders came up.",EXT,,SE1 11.15,
K&G,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 11.15,
H,"Yeah, so some like certain types of leaders. It might, uh, encourage some group members to speak, but some group leaders may not encourage to sustain group members to speak. So they mentioned one example which was how this girl, who is very shy and she shared her idea. But she she didn't she wasn't able to explain it very clearly. So after some time she didn't communicate her ideas anymore.",EXT,,SE1 11.15,
G,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 11.15,
H,"But when the group leader left like she started, she was alone with someone, she started, they started (inaudible) and then they listen to her. I think this shows a certain tension in the group.",EXT,,SE1 11.15,
K,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 11.15,
H,"Yeah, so that was talking about emotional challenge. Yeah, I think that was just one part, yeah. 
So basically they talk about the tools by don't know why they brought in the the this example. I think they are trying to illustrate the importance of resolving social emotional issues.",EXT,,SE1 11.15,
G&K,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 11.15,
H,"Yeah, the other one let me see if…maybe I didn't drop it in here. Let me just open it up. I'm not sure if it's the same as… Is I think it might be the same as the one that that K just showed just now. How do I change the share hold on…uh OK, I'll share a new one. Was this the same one?",ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
K,"Uh, no…umm? Yes, I think so! Yeah, yeah it was the same.",QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,The same one right?,ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
K,"Yes, so the second article of mine.",QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,"Yeah, but yes I also realize this is a mixture of both, but I think what we could use this part is that the area where they state the emotions and the challenge, they identify the challenge and how they are going to go about it.",CON,P,SE1 11.15,
K,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,So that is the use of scripting.,EXT,,SE1 11.15,
G,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 11.15,
H,Like with this scripting tool to help them. But behind is about is more on metacognition so I think only that this SSTS is useful for us.,CON,,SE1 11.15,
K,"I mean we can also do it, UM to both, we can first, UM, focus on emotional regulation and then we can also present tools that are connected with emotional regulation and and, uh, regarding metacognition. I mean, this could be a possibility how we can create our article maybe? If it isn't too much.",INT,P,SE1 11.15,
H&G,Ummm,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
G,"Uh, should we present…should we offer some role of tools like maybe a mediator factor between teachers and students? How these tools can help teachers understand the situation in the classroom, for example.",ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
K,"If we have enough, uh, data or enough information to verify this or to verify our statements then we can do this, yes.",INT,P,SE1 11.15,
H,So you mean to narrow down to how like certain tools that help teachers? To help teachers monitor or like facilitate?,ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
G,"I think it's, uh, both. They like how students can regulate their own emotions and also how this tool can help teachers to regulate, I don't know how to say, class environment overall.",INT,P,SE1 11.15,
K,"Yeah, we can also do this distinction. So we would first explain all the issue behind UM emotional regulation and then we would present some tools and then we would go into this distinction. OK, which tools could help like teachers and which tools could have like students and why.",INT,P,SE1 11.15,
G,Uh-huh. From teachers perspective and from students perspective.,INT,P,SE1 11.15,
K,This sounds good to me.,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,"Okay. So let's write down, uh framework.",EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
G,Uh-huh,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,hmm anyone wanted let me just?,ELI,,SE1 11.15,
K,Can you do it H or should I do it?,ELI,,SE1 11.15,
H,Sorry?,ELI,,SE1 11.15,
K,Can you do it or should I do it?,ELI,,SE1 11.15,
H,Yeah I can do it. Let me just open the file. I think half I think they might have thought that the meeting is just on Thursday.,EXT,,SE1 11.15,
K,Ahh Okay,QC,,SE1 11.15,
G,Hmm,QC,,SE1 11.15,
K,"But if it's helpful for the others, we can also do a meeting on Thursdays and just briefly brief them up.",EXT,F,SE1 11.15,
G,Or ask them to watch our recordings.,EXT,F,SE1 11.15,
K,Ohh yeah right yeah. I totally forgot about the record. Even better idea.,QC,F,SE1 11.15,
G,"Maybe after watching they can, uh, produce new ideas.",EXT,F,SE1 11.15,
K,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.15,
G,Based on our reasoning.,EXT,F,SE1 11.15,
H,Open a new document.,EXT,,SE1 11.15,
H,"OK, I'll just select this. So we were saying we can start with...
taking some time….OK, so we can start with a basic outline. 
We start with the…",EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
K,Introduction into emotional regulation.,EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
G,Uh-huh,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,All right emotional recommendation ,EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
G,"Maybe next, uh focus on problems in emotion regulation in uh, academic context.",INT,P,SE1 11.15,
H,"Emotion regulation... When we say OK of the context, do we want to specify in terms of like collaborative learning or just?",ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
K,"I think we need to do narrow it down. Also school we we we keep or we we still keep being on the school context, I think. ",INT,P,SE1 11.15,
G,Uh-huh,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
K,"And then yeah, the focus would be on collaboration.",INT,P,SE1 11.15,
H,"OK, so in collaborative environments ",EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
K,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
G,Uh-huh,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
G,"OK, uh, in academic context. Uh-huh.",EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
K,And this would be the bridge between our first point and the second point. The second point would be like that we present different possibilities or different tools.,INT,P,SE1 11.15,
H,Technological soultions? ,ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
K,Yeah,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
G,Uh-huh,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,The fascinated emotional regulations.,EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
K,"And then we have like the yeah, some tools that are presented in the articles.",EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
H,Some tools ,EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
G,Uh-huh,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
K,So what what are they like definition? What can they do and what do they have or what do they…,ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
G,Potential. Potential of these tools.,INT,P,SE1 11.15,
K,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
G,And maybe it's some restrictions.,INT,P,SE1 11.15,
K,Limitations yes.,EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
G,"Yes limitations. I thought, for example, storage data of your emotion collecttions, for example like this or...just (inaudible).",INT,P,SE1 11.15,
K,Yeah that's a good idea.,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,"OK, and then we are going to let this tools…",EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
K,"Uh, so which tools can be beneficial for teachers and which tools can be beneficial for students? Emotional regulation.",ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
G,Uh-huh,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,So are we going to separate like…,EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
G,"Or, maybe we can put in one point, uh…emotion regulation tool for teachers and students perspectives. Or…",CON,P,SE1 11.15,
K,Or we can just separate it when we do like 3.1 and 3.2 or 3A and 3B for example.,CON,P,SE1 11.15,
G,Uh-huh,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,Okay. So because we have given the examples up here right? So are we going to repeat like this? This like we have mentioned tool A and what it does. So when we come to this section?,ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
G,Or maybe we put in the second point the importance for teachers and students. That's why it's need for them. And the Third Point then examples.,CON,P,SE1 11.15,
H,So there are examples we will bring out that how is it useful for teachers and how is it useful for students?,ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
K,Yeah that makes sense.,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,"Yeah, if not will be we'll have to repeat our points again because we will mention the tools and then we will bring it out again.",INT,P,SE1 11.15,
K,"Yeah, that's true.",QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,"I think there's not many mention about like the need for teachers are in terms of a collaborative environment. They don't mention that much about how teachers, maybe a little bit, but like the importance of teachers, knowing how the students feel among their own group work.",CON,,SE1 11.15,
G,"Uh how scaffold, collaborative work maybe? How monitor and regulate or scaffold or facilitate collaborative group working.",ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
K,Yeah,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,"So, like how teachers, uh, their role is in terms of scaffolding?",ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
G,Yes.,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,"So for effective. So importance of what, what do you want to say is that importance of?",ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
K,Umm of the awareness of emotional regulation in collaboration.,EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
H,Just as for ,EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
G,The facilitator or…,EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
H,Emotional regulation…,EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
K,And,EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
G,"Active participator, participants.",EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
K,"Yeah and as collaborators, I mean they they need to collaborate with each other.",INT,P,SE1 11.15,
G,Main actors.,INT,P,SE1 11.15,
H,"OK, but I think this spot will be together with this part too right? With the problem.",INT,P,SE1 11.15,
K,Sorry?,ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
H,"So bring out the importance of emotional regulation as well. What do you like when we say like like why emotional regulation is important? Like because for the students, when you work together if this emotional challenging events and they do not like workout well like it's poison group work and they will not be motivated. So this part is also part of here actually.",EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
K,Hmm,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
G,"Yes, it's uh, the same. How to say in one framework?",ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
H,"Yeah, so I guess like what you meant in terms of this, like how each two benefit teachers and students is just a minor point. It's not really a main point?",ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
G,Yes,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,Like…this one small point ,EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
K,Yeah,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,"Okay. So then um...So our main research question still remains the same, right? Like what technological tools are there to facilitate?",ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
G,Uh-huh,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,The same one is our previous one that we write.,EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
K,"Yeah, I think this hasn't changed.",QC,P,SE1 11.15,
G,How technological technology tools can facilitate students.,EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
H,"Uh yeah, how can those tools can facilitate emotional…",EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
G,"Maybe not specify students, but uh, overall emotional regulation in academic context.",CON,P,SE1 11.15,
H,In collaborative learning?,ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
G,Yes.,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
K,Okay.,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,Like this?,ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
G,"Yes, we just we. We just explore one right? Yes, research question.",ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
K,"Yeah, yeah, I think this is enough. I mean, this is the overall, UM, research question of the whole article. If we came across some sub questions, we can also add them. But this is just the other question of the article.",INT,P,SE1 11.15,
H,Hmm,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
G,"So, uh, our aim is to explore existing UM existed, uh, technological tools? which facilitate emotional regulation in collaborative learning?",ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
K,Yeah,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
G,And maybe suggest something…. or just summarize?,ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
K,Summarize them or…,ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
H,Summarize and analyze it.,INT,P,SE1 11.15,
G,Umm,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
K,Regarding their beneficial aspects.,INT,P,SE1 11.15,
G,So we can prepare some kind of list of tools and define pros or cons for example.,INT,P,SE1 11.15,
K,Yeah,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,Hmm. We have a list of how many tools would we roughly want to look into 3 to 4?,ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
K,"I think not the amount is, UM, important. It's just UM the impact is important, I think. ",CON,P,SE1 11.15,
G,Yes I agree.,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
K,"Because there are so many tools. But yes, Umm, few tools just exist, but they aren't beneficial in any way so. I think we have to decide on which tools are really, really important or are really helpful.",CON,P,SE1 11.15,
H,"Yeah, but we'll probably be choosing like a few tools, right? That's we want to highlight in our paper, so, uh, do we have a a like number like, I think 10 would be too many for us to write in the paper.",CON,P,SE1 11.15,
K&G,Yes yes.,QC,P,SE1 11.15,
H,"Maybe we can have an estimate or something, uh, later on. or maybe we can just find what tools are there first? ",ELI,F,SE1 11.15,
K,Maybe between three to five?,ELI,F,SE1 11.15,
G,"Yes, like we we have 5 participants here.",INT,F,SE1 11.15,
K,Yeah,QC,F,SE1 11.15,
G,"Yes, just describe tools and think about which contribution they can give to collaborative learning.",EXT,F,SE1 11.15,
H,Yeah,QC,F,SE1 11.15,
G,"...think about limitation and restrictions. Maybe, uh, there will be some ethical restrictions as well.",EXT,F,SE1 11.15,
K,"Uh-huh They also need to be considered, that's true.",INT,F,SE1 11.15,
H,Okay,QC,F,SE1 11.15,
G,"For example, imagine how I can compare, for example, if I feel like happy but some face reader tool recognize me as surprising for example.",EXT,,SE1 11.15,
K,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 11.15,
G,"That's why maybe my how to say my notion about emotion is not correct. For example, I think it's a happy, but honestly, it's not a happy, it's surprise.",EXT,,SE1 11.15,
K,"Uh-huh, uh-huh. There's always the the issue with artificial, uh, with artificial intelligence that it can be that, it isn't always right.",INT,,SE1 11.15,
G,Yes.,QC,,SE1 11.15,
H,There are two possibilities. Either it is right and you are wrong or you are wrong and it's right,INT,,SE1 11.15,
K,"Yeah, that's true",QC,,SE1 11.15,
G,hhh,QC,,SE1 11.15,
H&K,Okay,QC,,SE1 11.15,
H,"I think seems like yeah, they really thought that is like we all only meet on the Thursday?",ELI,,SE1 11.15,
G,"Uh, maybe we just ask our our team, also A and K, to reach this and maybe suggest til Thursday some ideas.",INT,F,SE1 11.15,
H&K,Yeah,QC,F,SE1 11.15,
H,So this I would just put it OK…,EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
K,Then we can talk on Thursday about how we go further. So what will be the next steps.,EXT,F,SE1 11.15,
H,And ask what Essi thinks about this. ,EXT,F,SE1 11.15,
K,Yeah,QC,F,SE1 11.15,
G,Oh K!,EXT,,SE1 11.15,
H,"…narrow further or something, I don't know.",EXT,F,SE1 11.15,
G,"Should we add in the seven point, decide keywords and just add the technology tools collaborative learning…",ELI,F,SE1 11.15,
K,"Uh, when you would you like to highlight them like in bold then it's more visible?",ELI,,SE1 11.15,
H,Yes…,QC,,SE1 11.15,
G,K hello!,EXT,OT,SE1 11.15,
K,Hello!,EXT,OT,SE1 11.15,
KF,"Hello! Sorry guys I thought the meeting was on Thursday, yeah so I just rushed back from town.",EXT,,SE1 11.15,
H,"Oh okay, it's alright. Yeah, because we initially have a Monday and a another day meeting, yeah. I think you're probably taught it's only on Thursday.",EXT,,SE1 11.15,
KF,Yeah.,QC,,SE1 11.15,
K,"There will be the UM, explanation for the tool that Essi will introduce it to us.",EXT,,SE1 11.15,
G,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 11.15,
H,Yeah. So we came up with a brief idea. So from last session our topic that we are looking at was technological tools.,EXT,R,SE1 11.15,
KF,Okay.,QC,R,SE1 11.15,
G,Supported emotional regulation.,INT,R,SE1 11.15,
KF,"Yeah. Well, I haven't really started reading about that. I I I thought I was starting tomorrow.",EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
G,Uh,QC,,SE1 11.15,
KF,"Yeah, so I haven't really gone through any article about that.",EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
G,"Um but first of all, if you want, you can, uh, watch our recording because all our meetings recorded.",EXT,F,SE1 11.15,
KF,"OK. OK, OK, OK, I'll do that. Thanks.",QC,F,SE1 11.15,
H,"…defined...actually these two are similar. OK, maybe this is…",EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
G,"So we decided to introduce introduce uh technological tool, uh no, it reduce, uh, social emotional regulation first of all, what is it? Uh, yes, and try to define problems with emotion regulation and collaborative learning Uh, understand importance of awareness, emotion regulation from teachers and students perspective. And after that give some examples of existed technological solutions to facilitate emotion regulations. And our aim is we defined to summarize and analyze these tools also with benefits and limitations.",EXT,P,SE1 11.15,
H,Yeah so that's the general idea.,INT,P,SE1 11.15,
G,Uh-huh. If you have new ideas still Thursday it would be great if you…,EXT,,SE1 11.15,
KF,"Yeah, yeah I would.",QC,,SE1 11.15,
K,Alright. Anything else we need to discuss? Do we just postpone it to Thursday?,ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
G,I think.,QC,R,SE1 11.15,
H,I think that's around about it.,QC,R,SE1 11.15,
K,Uh-huh,QC,R,SE1 11.15,
H,"Yeah, I think that's all. I'm just trying to…because it's all different… okay",EXT,R,SE1 11.15,
K,Alright. So is it all clear to you K? Or do you have any questions?,ELI,P,SE1 11.15,
KF,"No, no, I'll I'll. I'll definitely have to watch the video before I catch up.",QC,F,SE1 11.15,
G,Okay,QC,,SE1 11.15,
H,Yeah,QC,,SE1 11.15,
KF, I'll do that and catch up.,EXT,F,SE1 11.15,
K,Alright.,QC,,SE1 11.15,
G,Nice to meet you K,EXT,OT,SE1 11.15,
KF,"Nice to meet you, too",QC,OT,SE1 11.15,

KF,"Ah okay. And my background has always been education. So Umm, yeah. ",EXT,OT,SE1 11.15,
G,We have one student first year student in our uh LET program from Ghana.,EXT,OT,SE1 11.15,
KF,Oh really? Oh okay that's nice.,QC,OT,SE1 11.15,
H,"What premise are you in? Is it a technology learning technology program, G?",ELI,OT,SE1 11.15,
G,Learning education and technology. ,QC,OT,SE1 11.15,
H,Oh okay.,QC,OT,SE1 11.15,
G,"This is program learning education and technology, the name of program.",EXT,OT,SE1 11.15,
KF,Yeah yeah I think I applied for that program too in Oulu.,EXT,OT,SE1 11.15,
H,Okay.,QC,OT,SE1 11.15,
G,"And you, which program?",ELI,OT,SE1 11.15,
KF,"Well, it isn't technology. Something like that in Oulu University.",QC,OT,SE1 11.15,
G,Hmm,QC,OT,SE1 11.15,
KF,Yeah I apply but I think once I I I heard offer from truku I I I accepted to I didn't know the results from Oulu.,EXT,OT,SE1 11.15,
G,Hmm,QC,OT,SE1 11.15,
H,Ah okay because Turku was the first one right?,ELI,OT,SE1 11.15,
KF,Yeah yeah yeah,QC,OT,SE1 11.15,
H,And we have. I'm sorry quickly.,EXT,OT,SE1 11.15,
H,Is your course the one that you have to come up with some technological tools in the for your thesis or something?,ELI,OT,SE1 11.15,
G,"No, no technological tools, just emotion regulation in my master's thesis",QC,OT,SE1 11.15,
H,Ah okay.,QC,OT,SE1 11.15,
G,"And parenting, parenting styles and emotion regulation.",QC,OT,SE1 11.15,
H,"Ah okay, so how's your thesis is going?",ELI,OT,SE1 11.15,
G,Umm just start theoretical framework.,QC,OT,SE1 11.15,
H,Ah okay.,QC,OT,SE1 11.15,
G,And you could K…,ELI,OT,SE1 11.15,
K,But you still have time or is it pressure already on you to finish it?,ELI,OT,SE1 11.15,
G,"How to say, uh, as a group we have some deadlines, for example till tomorrow we should present our theoretical framework to our peers for commenting.",EXT,OT,SE1 11.15,
K,Uh-huh,QC,OT,SE1 11.15,
G,That's why I think I'm on deadlines,EXT,OT,SE1 11.15,
K,Okay,QC,OT,SE1 11.15,
H,"I see. It's an busy period right now, like the end of the term.",QC,OT,SE1 11.15,
G,Umm,QC,OT,SE1 11.15,
H,"Yeah, all right. I think we can end the meeting here?",ELI,,SE1 11.15,
K&G,Yes!,QC,,SE1 11.15,
H,"And then we'll meet on Thursday. I'm not sure how long it will take on Thursday because I thought it was just a short one, but hum... ",EXT,,SE1 11.15,
G,At 9 finish time.,QC,,SE1 11.15,
K,Yeah,QC,,SE1 11.15,
H,Because I arranged another meeting after hopefully we end after…,EXT,,SE1 11.15,
K,"H, when you have to leave earlier, you can also do it. I mean that's…",QC,,SE1 11.15,
H,Yeah I think I can just catch up on whatever I missed. Yeah.,QC,,SE1 11.15,

G,OK. Recording.,QC,,SE1 11.22,
K,"So first we need to do the group
feedback, am I right?",ELI,F,SE1 11.22,
H,"I think we can do after the
meeting because on the document that I saw that
shows- they asked us about the, uhm…
Essi mentioned that we have to do it before this meeting?",ELI,F,SE1 11.22,
G,"As I remember, yes.",QC,F,SE1 11.22,
H,OK.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
G,"Uh, as I remember, it should
be till 21st of November.",EXT,F,SE1 11.22,

another questionnaire?",ELI,F,SE1 11.22,
G,Mhm.,QC,,SE1 11.22,
H,Where?,ELI,,SE1 11.22,

H,"Sometimes I do it (inaudible) check. No, not this. This one. This one.",EXT,,SE1 11.22,
G,Did you find it? No?,ELI,,SE1 11.22,
H,"Oh OK, OK, let me just do it
very quickly. Ah.",QC,,SE1 11.22,
G,"Did you find the link? I can share
it again.",ELI,P,SE1 11.22,
H,"Let me share the link. It was- it was (inaudible) yesterday. OK, I didn't see. I don't usually check that. Did you send the link, uh, (inaudible)? Yeah, yeah, I see. No, okay.",EXT,P,SE1 11.22,
G,Just a moment. I’ll get back.,EXT,,SE1 11.22,
H,"OK, I'm done with it, so everyone has done the survey?",ELI,P,SE1 11.22,
A,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.22,
K,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.22,
H,"OK, so I'm the only one, I guess. (inaudible) should be in here. Okay. So am I sharing the right thing? Let me share the… Document. OK, so we can start working on this one. We can start with the introduction.",EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
A,Mhm.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
H,I’ll make some edits.,EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
K,"So. What do you think, how we should write this essay? Do you want to write this essay as a whole and together. Or should we split the different parts of the essay so that
everybody writes his or her part of the essay? So what we just discussed here, the- the main points of the different- 
different parts. So what do you think?",ELI,F,SE1 11.22,
A,"I think, uh, splitting it is probably like the easiest.",QC,F,SE1 11.22,
K,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
A,"Wait, I think it'd be difficult to write, like-",EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
H,Together.,EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
G,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
K,"That’s exactly what I thought, that's why I'm asking here.",ELI,F,SE1 11.22,
H,"Yeah, we can split up the different parts.",QC,F,SE1 11.22,
A,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
H,"Introduction, maybe we can… maybe put a rough skeleton like… introduction and what it involves.",EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
A,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
K,"Yeah, yeah, that's also what I thought and I already saw that in the Excel sheet, we already have some good points, um, for the introduction and all the other parts of our essay. So, that is quite helpful.",INT,F,SE1 11.22,
H,OK.  ,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
G,"Sorry, today I'm not effective in this meeting because I'm so tired.",EXT,OT,SE1 11.22,
A,Don't worry.,EXT,OT,SE1 11.22,
H,"I think maybe this meeting we would, uh, will have a talk about the brief outline and then we can split that who do which part.",EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
G,Uh-huh.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
H,"Yeah, and just work on it on our own
time.",EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
A,"Yeah, that makes the most sense.",QC,F,SE1 11.22,
H,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
A,"K, do you also agree?",ELI,F,SE1 11.22,
H,"Yeah, I think he…",QC,F,SE1 11.22,
KF,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I do agree.",QC,F,SE1 11.22,
K,OK.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
H,"OK, so introduction will have a part about, uhm, why is emotional regulation important.",EXT,,SE1 11.22,
A,Mhm.,QC,,SE1 11.22,
K,And first I think we need to also define what exactly emotional regulation is.,EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
H,Mhm.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
A,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
H,"OK, good, so let's start with defining emotional regulation. Then, why is it important in a collaborative environment.",INT,F,SE1 11.22,
A,Mhm.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
A,"Me, I mean if- if nobody, or if it's OK, I- I'd be, I can work on the introduction. Or are we gonna split the introduction?",ELI,F,SE1 11.22,
G,"I think we can split introduction as well, between us.",QC,F,SE1 11.22,
A,"Yeah. Like the problems for instance. Um, 'cause I think it actually pairs well, like I did this- am doing this presentation on multimodal research.",EXT,,SE1 11.22,
K,Uh-huh.,QC,,SE1 11.22,
A,"And problems with emotional regulation is, I guess it's multimodal in nature. It's different or difficult, and but yeah. But if someone else like really wants…",EXT,,SE1 11.22,
K,"No, for me, it's fine, so I can do anything. I don't have any preferences.",CON,F,SE1 11.22,
G,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
H,OK.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
K,"Um, and I think that also problems in collaborative learning with regard to, um, and virtual environment like that we have, and, um…",EXT,,SE1 11.22,
H,(inaudible) to... emotional regulation right?,INT,,SE1 11.22,
K,Yeah.,QC,,SE1 11.22,
H,OK.,QC,,SE1 11.22,
G,Also in my thesis is I am- I have already defined emotion regulation and maybe next meeting I can present it to you.,EXT,P,SE1 11.22,
K,Mhm.,QC,P,SE1 11.22,
G,"So, um, some writing I just can't put this writing in our teams document.",EXT,P,SE1 11.22,
K,So you-,EXT,P,SE1 11.22,
H,"(inaudible) already put the definition
here.",EXT,P,SE1 11.22,
G,Yes.,QC,P,SE1 11.22,
H,OK.,QC,P,SE1 11.22,
K,"So that means that you and A (inaudible) you will, uh, do the introduction.",ELI,F,SE1 11.22,
A,"Yeah, I'm OK with that. Maybe another subtopic in the introduction would be, uhm, why there may be a need for technological tools.",QC,F,SE1 11.22,
H,Mm.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
A,Or…,CON,F,SE1 11.22,
G,I'm sorry- (inaudible) just interrupt you. Should we define emotional regulation in the introduction? Or should it be in one of the key concepts? In the body of the article.,ELI,F,SE1 11.22,
K,Good question.,EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
G,I think it should be in the main body.,EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
K,Main body?,ELI,F,SE1 11.22,
G,Like a chapter.,EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
K,"Mhm, but then we need something else
for our introduction.",EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
H,How will we start doing things?,ELI,F,SE1 11.22,
A,"Yeah, um, 'cause, mmm.",QC,F,SE1 11.22,
K,"Maybe when we start with, umm, like usually introduction in- in richer learning environments that COVID has come to and then- all teaching stuff has changed, and that's why we… I don't know.",EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
G,"Oh, maybe we use… how to say, no, not cooperating, but collaborative approach. For example, each of us creates some introduction, and in the next meeting we can combine it.",CON,F,SE1 11.22,
K,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
G,"For example, I can write, uh, I don't know how many ten- ten, or maybe two paragraphs, 10 statements? I don't know how much, but I just try to write my thoughts and try to paste, try to link to the some references and you, K, do as well, and A, K, and H as well and after that we read- look through this, all our articles and combine this introduction together.",EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
K,"I think this idea is great, but should we all do it? Isn't it too much work? There-",ELI,F,SE1 11.22,
H,"You might be, uh-",QC,F,SE1 11.22,
K,(inaudible) introduction.,ELI,F,SE1 11.22,
H,"Yeah, I think we can divide it more so that-",QC,F,SE1 11.22,
K,"Yeah, yeah.",QC,F,SE1 11.22,
G,"Uh, what text do we have, uh, except introduction?",ELI,F,SE1 11.22,
H,"I think we can talk about the roles of like teachers and
students. In terms of emotional regulation.",EXT,,SE1 11.22,
A,Mhm.,QC,,SE1 11.22,
H,"This could be, a… like between intro- like introduction to body.",EXT,,SE1 11.22,
K,Yeah.,QC,,SE1 11.22,
H,So like I just put it under here. Uhm. How’d I call it? Nevermind. Roles. ,EXT,P,SE1 11.22,
K,"Yeah, then we can cover these two sections. Until the, uh, next meeting.",QC,F,SE1 11.22,
H,Mmm…,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
K,"Or is it too much? So, I mean we split it up. Let's say that G and I, we will write up a part of the introduction. Then A, will do the emotional part of what, what?
What was your, your preference?",ELI,F,SE1 11.22,
A,"Uhm? I think it's deleted now. World problems, yeah, problems and. I guess, you know, problems in
collaborative learning, in virtual learning environment or, I- I'm- I'm OK with whatever honestly but I- I 'cause I think the other part was… I don't see it anymore, the subtopic, it was a…",QC,,SE1 11.22,
H,The teachers and students?,ELI,,SE1 11.22,
A,Problems… with emotional… I forget how it was worded.,QC,,SE1 11.22,
H,"It's just, actually, I think it's the same thing, right? Because I removed it (inaudible). It's just this one, like I just brought it down, the importance of awareness.",EXT,,SE1 11.22,
A,"Uh, yeah, probably yeah.",QC,,SE1 11.22,
K,Yeah.,QC,,SE1 11.22,
H,"Because it's the same as saying what is the need for emotional regulation, so I took it down.",EXT,,SE1 11.22,
K,Yeah.,QC,,SE1 11.22,
A,…problems in collaborative learning and virtual learning environment.,EXT,,SE1 11.22,
K,"Yeah, then you could cover this- this topic and then… If it's suitable for you, G, and for you, K, you could go with the teacher and students' roles if you like.
",ELI,F,SE1 11.22,
H,"Yeah, I think I can do this part.",QC,F,SE1 11.22,
G,Uh-huh.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
K,"So you can, maybe you can, you can do the teachers part and K the students part. Or you can also switch it. I don't
know, just a suggestion. I don't want to to force
anybody.",EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
KF,OK.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
H,"So these two parts will be… The first two parts would be
both of you, right? G and-",ELI,F,SE1 11.22,
G,K and. ,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
H,And then this will be…,EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
K,"A, yeah.",QC,F,SE1 11.22,
A,Cool.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
K,And the technological tools we can talk about next meeting.,ELI,F,SE1 11.22,
G,Yes.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
K,"OK, so is it doable for everybody? In a week.",ELI,F,SE1 11.22,
H,"This is good, yeah.",QC,F,SE1 11.22,
A,"Yeah, definitely.",QC,F,SE1 11.22,
H,"We talk about (inaudible) in the document. We are supposed to come off a fra- there's also a framework, but I don't know what framework.",EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
K,"My thing with framework is meant like the structure of an empirical article. Like, you start with the introduction or with the abstract, then you…",EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
H,Which is the (inaudible) structure that-,ELI,F,SE1 11.22,
K,"Yeah, followed by the theoretical background and the method, and- but we don't actually have a method.",CON,F,SE1 11.22,
H,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
K,…how we should do this. Maybe we can we- maybe we can just explain-,ELI,F,SE1 11.22,
H,…it will be just the tools then.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
A,Yeah. So.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
K,"The tools, and then we can also explain which articles we selected for our article maybe. We can think about… this.",INT,F,SE1 11.22,
G,"I just copy paste from, um, from partners document- instruction for collaborate- collaboration phase.",EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
K,Mhm.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
G,General structure. For the article.,EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
K,So the abstract is… will be written in the end-,EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
G,Yes.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
K,Because then we'll know what the article is about exactly.,EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
G,"And now we are in the phase introduction and literature review, as I understand.",EXT,P,SE1 11.22,
K,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.22,
H,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.22,
K,"OK, and then the analysis and the, the- method- methodology, methodology and analysis part is done for next week with the technological tools.",ELI,F,SE1 11.22,
G,"Yes, I think so.",QC,F,SE1 11.22,
K,"And yeah, I think that sounds great.",QC,F,SE1 11.22,
H,"OK, I'll put this on top, maybe, and then I'll put all these things within the sections.",EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
K,Mhm.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
G,"And as I understand, we need to fill the FROCOLE application after two weeks.",EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
H,Two weeks.,EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
G,Or Not?,CON,F,SE1 11.22,
K,"No, I thought, uh, um after each meeting.",CON,P,SE1 11.22,
A,"Yeah. I… When I watched the last, the last meeting, the recording, I think it was, yeah, after every meeting. For- for the app, right? That's why we're here.",QC,P,SE1 11.22,
G,"Mhm. But hey, can I share my screen?",ELI,,SE1 11.22,
H,"Yeah, let me just stop this.",QC,,SE1 11.22,
G,"Again, back to the instruction of collaborative phase. Use of FROCOLE application after both online group meetings.",CON,F,SE1 11.22,
H,"OK, so every meeting will use to write down, I guess.",QC,F,SE1 11.22,
G,"It means after… this is the first meeting. And the next meeting next Monday, for example, and after next Monday we need to fill this. Or- or- or just after today's meeting?",ELI,F,SE1 11.22,
K,I think after today's meeting and next meeting. That's how I understood from the instructions.,INT,F,SE1 11.22,
G,OK OK yes.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
K,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
G,So I had one week how to… Refresh or change my password.,EXT,P,SE1 11.22,
K,Did- you did you text Essi?,ELI,P,SE1 11.22,
G,"Not yet. I try to remember, maybe change. Uh, what… can you help me in the screen of login? Uh, in your name. It's your nickname or full name?",ELI,P,SE1 11.22,
H,Nickname.,EXT,,SE1 11.22,
G,Mhm.,QC,,SE1 11.22,
K,"OK, is there anything we need to discuss?",ELI,P,SE1 11.22,
H,"That's about it, so we'll have this done. So. I don't know why they asked us to write the… results as well, but I don't know what results.",EXT,P,SE1 11.22,
K,"Maybe at the results one we can just share our experience with education and with technological tools for emotional regulation like our- our experiences with the FROCOLE.
Maybe we can reflect that-",EXT,P,SE1 11.22,
H,"I think we can discuss about the- the- the few apps that we want to choose, because I think they did- they didn't put up a section for that.",EXT,P,SE1 11.22,
G,"Uh- oh, maybe results, understand what we expect.",EXT,P,SE1 11.22,
K,"What we expect- Oh, also, what is the result of our research
questions? How did- our research questions can be answered?",INT,P,SE1 11.22,
G,Mhm.,QC,P,SE1 11.22,
H,"Alright, yeah, I think this looks good.
OK, I think that's- that should be alright.",EXT,R,SE1 11.22,
K,Mhm.,QC,R,SE1 11.22,
H,"OK, so then I think we can end the meeting?",ELI,R,SE1 11.22,
G,Uh-huh.,QC,R,SE1 11.22,
K,"Does everybody know what to do? Are there any questions?
Concerns?",ELI,P,SE1 11.22,

K,Perfect.,QC,P,SE1 11.22,
A,Cool.,QC,P,SE1 11.22,
H,OK.,QC,P,SE1 11.22,
K,So the next meeting will be next Monday. Or do we need a meeting on Thursday?,ELI,F,SE1 11.22,
A,I think next Monday is fine.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,
K,"Yeah, I think so.",QC,F,SE1 11.22,
H,We get our parts done by next Monday and we can- yeah.,EXT,F,SE1 11.22,
K,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.22,

H,OK.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,Can you see it?,ELI,P,SE1 11.30,
G,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
H,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,"So, G and I, we wrote the
introduction.",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
H,Uh-huh.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,"And G I saw your stuff, you made quite a lot. That's so good.",EXT,,SE1 11.30,
G,"Yeah, and uh, I left some- I left some comments, maybe.",QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,"Yeah, I already had a look at it. And you're right, we should change this sentence.",INT,P,SE1 11.30,
G,Because- maybe just delete the positive instead because-,INT,P,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
G,"emotions contribute to their own
process itself.",INT,P,SE1 11.30,
K,I can… just make this black again. ,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
G,Uh-huh.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,And you can delete this comment.,EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
G,Yes.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,"Alright. Uhm? Did you, uh, highlight this one?",ELI,P,SE1 11.30,
G,"Yes, I wrote it. Uh, to be sure that the whole body- that we include some summary here, to describe the body.",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
H,"Yeah, I think that's the thesis statement right? Our (inaudible) pointing back. So our focus.",QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,"Yeah, so we, we just describe our process in the body.",QC,P,SE1 11.30,
G,Mhm.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
A,"So. Yeah, the problems and challenges I wrote. It's a little bit- uhm, it's still like very much a rough draft. I didn't write as much as G.",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
G,OK.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
A,"But um. Yeah, I don't know if you guys got the chance to read through it. But basically the first paragraph is mostly just about, um, the multimodal nature of human emotion, which I state that it makes it difficult to research.",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
A,"And I got this from this article that I- I put in, umm, in-",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
G,Mitre.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
A,"Yeah, um. It's called signals, umm, from signals to knowledge, but yeah, but then after that, erm. I don't know I- I was wondering if you guys had any other input of like. Uhm, other problems I should mention. Or if I should expand on…",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
K,"I think when you have a look at the Excel sheet, I think there was a section in which, uh, we deal with problems, but I'm not sure yet.",CON,P,SE1 11.30,
A,OK.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,Maybe I will have a look.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
A,"Yeah, and then the- the second paragraph was about how, uhm, like tools that have been developed to help regulate emotion have mainly just been in like the conventional classroom setting. And not in like an online format.",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
G,Mhm.,QC,,SE1 11.30,
A,"Where- where there's not as much supervision, so… ",EXT,,SE1 11.30,
K,"Well, this sounds good to me, so- and quite logical.",QC,P,SE1 11.30,
A,"OK, cool.",QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,"Umm. There, this is the data that I meant. Umm, I'm- I'm not sure who put this into the Excel sheet, but there it says to define a problem.",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
A,Uh-huh.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,You can find some- something there.,EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
A,OK.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
G,"Yes, you can use our resources as well.",QC,P,SE1 11.30,
A,"Yeah yeah, yeah. Um. (inaudible) So, yeah, I think if I mention- maybe if I expand that a bit more, like, mentioned maybe two more main problems.",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
K,"That should be enough, I mean, uhm, it shouldn't be a whole book. It's just an overview.",INT,P,SE1 11.30,
A,OK.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
H,"Yeah, I think we can be more focused on, like, the main issue at hand, and because our main body is the different technological tools…",INT,P,SE1 11.30,
A,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
G,Uh-huh.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
H,So the introduction doesn't have to be so long.,INT,P,SE1 11.30,
A,"OK, OK.",QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,OK. Then was the part-,EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
G,I described here emotion and emotion regulation.,EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
K,"Uh-huh. This is then, the introduction from the body, like, where we deal with emotional regulation. And this is… ",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
G,"Again, again, can you repeat?",ELI,P,SE1 11.30,
K,"This is then the start of the main body, I think. When we explain emotional regulation.",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
G,"Yes, yes yes. I thought about this as well.",QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah. Awesome.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
G,"By the way, problems and challenges- should we combine- uh, to integrate it in- in the introduction as well?",ELI,P,SE1 11.30,
K,Hmm.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
G,And not make a specific chapter for this.,EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
A,Yeah. Maybe.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,"Yeah. Because this leads them to, to our explanation that why- why we want to deal with emotional regulation and the techno- technical tools. Yeah, then we'll just leave this.",INT,P,SE1 11.30,
A,OK.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,And then we need a- But then we need to put this part like so.,INT,P,SE1 11.30,
G,"Yes, in the end. OK, A, you can read again all- the whole introduction and try to integrate it. Thoughts?",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
A,"Yeah, yeah.",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"Maybe if it's necessary, when you read, maybe change the order.",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
A,OK.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
G,And make it more coherent.,EXT,F,SE1 11.30,
A,"Yeah, got it.",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"Then this is emotions and emotional regulation. Uhm? Actually I didn't read it right now, but I will have a look at this maybe this evening or tomorrow and then I can give some feedback, if you’d like.",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"Yes, yes.",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"I think we could remove the defining, yeah?",ELI,P,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
H,So I just (inaudible) the order. I thought I'll put the students’ roles first before the teachers’ roles.,EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
G,"Uh-huh. Yes, and I added background. I've read it and I think it can give us a lot of food for thought.",QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,Uh-huh.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
H,"I think because (inaudible), he gives a more general- it's not really specific to collaborative learning.",EXT,,SE1 11.30,
G,"Yes, yes.",QC,,SE1 11.30,
H,"Only take the parts that are, like, if I want to pick the parts on collaborative learning it’s quite little, so I just picked a little bit.",EXT,,SE1 11.30,
G,Uh-huh.,QC,,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah. But should we write here like- like a bridge for the… this-,ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"Yeah, a linking paragraph maybe?",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"Yeah, that's what I looked for. Uh-",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"By the way, what way should we mention our, uh, research questions? Our aim and research questions.",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"Maybe here. At the end here, like.",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
G,OK.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
K,But I don't know. What do you think?,ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"Because we just mentioned the problems up here already, right? The problems in online learning, collaborative learning and how there are problems with emotion regulation just before.",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
G,Maybe this question we should ask (inaudible).,EXT,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"Yeah, I guess it's somewhere we can integrate it together with this yellow highlight part.",INT,F,SE1 11.30,
G,Mhm.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"I think this was trying to say what we are going to do in this article, which is something like a research question but it's not phrased in the sense.",INT,P,SE1 11.30,
K,(inaudible) the notes here that we know what to do.,EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
H,"Yeah, maybe you could put a different color , because- yeah.",QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
H,"Yeah, put the- that same color is anything that we need to add onto here.",QC,P,SE1 11.30,
G,"I created, uh, a document of questions for Essi. And now try to note down some questions that arise during our conversation.",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
H,"I think, uh, K, you can highlight the pink part for the linking paragraphs or like anything that's (inaudible).",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
G,Mhm.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
H,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,"Alright. Uhm, this deals with emotional regulation again. This is from-",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
H,"Yeah, (inaudible) this part.",QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,So…,EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
H,He gave a small introduction on emotions again.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,"Yeah, should we delete it or should we remove it?",ELI,P,SE1 11.30,
G,"Uh, we should highlight in yellow and ask maybe K.",INT,P,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah. OK. Uhm?,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
H,"(inaudible) this entire part. Because I think he might have done his part, um independently, like without knowing what we did on top and below. That's why he thought he needed a header to lead into his part.",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah. This is repeated content. ,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
H,"Well, I guess like if we want to remove it, that's fine too. Or if we want to integrate it into our part, that’s fine as well.",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
K,"Then, this part is… I think OK? Have you read through it?",ELI,P,SE1 11.30,
H,"I’ve briefly read through. Yeah, it was from the shared regulation.",QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,"Yeah, the um, the only thing that I can see is that we should have a look at the citation he makes because they are like-",CON,P,SE1 11.30,
G,"Yeah, yes yes yes yes, it's not APA style.",QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,I'm just…,EXT,,SE1 11.30,
H,Then comma after the… (inaudible),EXT,,SE1 11.30,
K,I’ll just make a comment and then he can… ,EXT,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"Yeah, maybe we can just say check the citation.",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
K,“Be careful with citations…”,EXT,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"Like laters (Reading authors), usually it's et al.",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
H,"Et al. Yeah, I think he use a different, not APA.",QC,P,SE1 11.30,
G,"Yeah, APA 7th I used.",QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,"Yeah. Okay. And this was your part, H?",ELI,P,SE1 11.30,
H,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,"This looks good to me. Yeah, I don't have anything…",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
H,"Yeah, you can just change it.",QC,P,SE1 11.30,
G,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 11.30,
K,I think we're doing well.,EXT,R,SE1 11.30,
H,"Yeah, it's good.",QC,R,SE1 11.30,
A,Yeah.,QC,R,SE1 11.30,
H,So maybe you can copy the research question part and bring it up to the higher- the…,ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"After the introduction or at the end of the introduction, yes? Or where? ",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"We are going to put the research question on a yellow part, right?",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"But I highlighted this in- in questions for Essi. Don't worry, we ask.",EXT,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"Sorry, G, what do you mean?",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"Ah, I created a new document, questions for Essi and now I make some minutes, what we should ask Essi on Thursday.",EXT,F,SE1 11.30,
K,Mhm.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
H,So you're asking us if- what question-,ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"No, I just ask where we should-",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
H,Put the-,ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"Put the- yes, put the research question.",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
A,Mhm,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"Ah, OK.",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"Maybe, for example, it should be after emotion regulation. Or- because I'm not sure, that's why I want to ask you.",EXT,F,SE1 11.30,
A,OK.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
H,Do we need a part about tech- just a short part about technological tools? Or that will be the… main body?,ELI,P,SE1 11.30,
A,I think…,EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
G,"Actually, I think about… For example, we can share. We can divide between us some tools. Uh, and describe it, but I have a question. Do we have a criteria? How can we… analyze it?",ELI,P,SE1 11.30,
K,"What do you mean with analyze it? So, uh-",ELI,P,SE1 11.30,
G,"By which I mean by which criteria we should go by when we analyze each tool. For, for example, a criteria, uh, it's user friendly, and uh… I don't know what else criteria can be. Is it acceptable or?",ELI,P,SE1 11.30,
K,"I thought that we wanted to- to split the tools into two parts, like the one part is dealing with, um- ",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
G,Teachers and students?,ELI,P,SE1 11.30,
K,"Teachers, yeah and the other one would be students.",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
G,"Ah, OK, maybe.",QC,P,SE1 11.30,
A,"Maybe, uh. Should I maybe mention some examples of like a- in my part when I mentioned how, um. Yeah, there- there have been tools that have had success in the conventional classroom, but maybe not in an online collaborative environment. Should I mention those as examples, like this stuff that had success in… Or you think it's- I don't know.",ELI,P,SE1 11.30,
G,"And really, yes, that's the question, where we would like to use these tools in an online environment. Or in a face-to-face environment.",INT,P,SE1 11.30,
A,I thought we were-,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
G,Online.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,Online.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
G,Uh-huh.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
A,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
H,"So the research question, do we need to put, uh- online- of the collaborative learning? (inaudible) technological tools or facilitate.",ELI,P,SE1 11.30,
K,Umm? In-,EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
H,"Virtual learning, virtual setting?",ELI,P,SE1 11.30,
K,Virtual learning environments. Yeah. OK.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
G,"So, as I understand, each tool, uh, can be considered through 2 dimensions, teachers and students, yes?",ELI,P,SE1 11.30,
H,"So I'm thinking, (inaudible) there's so many things to say about that.",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
K,"I think maybe we should, erm, decide on which tech- which technological tools we would like to focus on.",INT,F,SE1 11.30,
A,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"What do you think about if every one of us just presents one tool, so everybody picks a tool and then describes it.",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"Yes, maybe.",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"So I think in the Excel sheet there were a few already, right?",ELI,P,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
G,"EMODA, EMODA as I know.",QC,P,SE1 11.30,
K,"Uhm? Right, I will have a look.",EXT,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"I asked my classmates, and they’re from different groups, about the methodology they used in- in their articles and they said me, one group said to me that, uh, they try to create a new tool, some kind of new tool.",EXT,,SE1 11.30,
A,Really?,ELI,,SE1 11.30,
G,"Based on existing ones, yes.",EXT,,SE1 11.30,
K,Wow.,QC,,SE1 11.30,
H,So they made recommendations.,QC,,SE1 11.30,
G,"Yes, yes, made some recommendations.",QC,,SE1 11.30,
K,"But we can also- can we write like our- or can we present our tools as the method? Like the methodology part? Like that this is our method, the different tools and then the conclusion and discussion are about our own experiences with these tools, for example, or with FROCOLE for example.",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
G,I think FROCOLE should be included in our tools as well.,INT,F,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"FROCOLE will be one of the tools. I think maybe we can just look at the the one technology tools. Because this one, some of them are not specifically emotional regulation.",CON,F,SE1 11.30,
K,Umm.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
H,That's why I extracted the main ones in technological tools in the previous one. So this- this (inaudible) NCST and as regulation.,CON,F,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"Then radar, reflector… This would be 7 tools.",EXT,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"Yeah, so I think we can choose the main- the- those that are more targeted at emotions-",INT,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"Emotion, yes.",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
H,(inaudible) also sell regulation learning.,INT,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"Yeah, so it would be EMODA for example. Maybe this one?",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
G,I'm not sure about Qridi.,CON,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"I think I put it there, it was uhm. The whole study was about Qridi.  And it was a different tool (inaudible).",EXT,,SE1 11.30,
G,"Yes, it's a like, a, model metrics.",QC,,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah.,QC,,SE1 11.30,
H,Is it like the focal metrics that we had?,ELI,,SE1 11.30,
G,"No, no, no. It's means (inaudible) metrical. For example, heart rate or different impulses into your body, skin, skin metrics.",EXT,,SE1 11.30,
H,"Oh, OK.",QC,,SE1 11.30,
K,These are all peer assessment tools. ,INT,,SE1 11.30,
H,"Yeah. Radar and Reflector, they are- like kind of together.",INT,,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah.,QC,,SE1 11.30,
H,Maybe we can- I think the first- first or second one is quite… Emotion.,INT,,SE1 11.30,
G,I just highlighted in green.,EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
H,"The second one was not specifically emotions. It involves like different aspects, work motivation, emotions and cognition and then they read on the traffic light. But it's the same- similar idea where we read our own self, and enrich our group and then we'll see.",EXT,,SE1 11.30,
K,So we can put (inaudible) Radar- are you talking about Radar?,ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"Um, no. The one just on- the second one.",CON,,SE1 11.30,
K,"Oh, this one?",ELI,,SE1 11.30,
H,"Uh, yeah.",QC,,SE1 11.30,
K,We can put Radar or FROCOLE for example.,EXT,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"Yeah, I think we can compare it to FROCOLE like how a traffic light- is it more visual or something but no- the underlying basis is the same. So in discussion maybe we can talk about the underlying basis depth. Or these users or something? I don’t know (inaudible). ",INT,F,SE1 11.30,
K,Mhm. Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"Yeah. We need (inaudible) four, right? One of them is FROCOLE right? Maybe you can write FROCOLE and (inaudible).",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"So, as I see, uh, now we can have- with FROCOLE- four tools.",INT,F,SE1 11.30,
H,OK.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"Uh, that we can explain and also, uh, one of us can explain other tools like Radar or Reflector or Qridi. Just make some summary of other tools.",INT,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"Yeah, that's awesome.",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
H,Or we don't exactly need to have five tools because that is quite a lot. Right? We don't need to have one person one tool.,CON,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"What, can you repeat please?",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"Uh, we don't need to have five tools because that might be a lot- I'm not sure.",CON,F,SE1 11.30,
G,Mhm.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
H,Maybe four?  I don't know.,ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
A,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
H,Is 5 a lot or?,ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
A,I was thinking 5 is a lot.,CON,F,SE1 11.30,
H,Yeah. I think we should go with around 3. Normally in examples there was three case studies or three cases.,CON,F,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
A,I think 3 is a nice number.,CON,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"Yeah, so maybe 3-4- four is OK.",CON,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"OK, for- for- for our goal is one of four.",INT,F,SE1 11.30,
K,Sounds great.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"Or like are there any ones that are quite similar, then we can drop off?",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"Uhm? No, I don't think so because they are, umm, focusing on different parts of the like, like…",CON,F,SE1 11.30,
H,Oh OK.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
G,Aspects dimension.,EXT,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"Uh, yeah.",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"OK, so then we can do- four. And maybe the last person can work a bit more on the discussion or something- I don't know.",INT,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"Yeah, and we can also ask Essi on Thursday about the discussion,  what she thinks is best to write in the discussion.",INT,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"Uh, yeah.",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
A,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
K,We should put our own experiences or our own thoughts in it. Or how we should do it.,EXT,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"Also, again, a suggestion, as I said earlier, just create criteria- (inaudible)-  Criteria in place. Maybe I can create before Thursday? Sorry, just a moment... It's- it's a kid.",CON,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"So I, I can suggest that till Thursday I can create- or maybe think about some… template, how we can analyze each tool.",INT,F,SE1 11.30,
K,OK.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"For example, target groups, what else, size, maybe it's-",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
K,Maybe also the educational benefit of the tool?,ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
A,Mhm,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"Yes, yes, my build is- I think then we analyze each tool. We should follow one guideline- guidance.",INT,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"Yeah, that's a good idea, and it's true.",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
H,Uh-huh.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"Because it's easy to compare after that in discussion. For
example, each tools.",INT,F,SE1 11.30,
A,Yeah. Definitely.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
H,OK. Sure.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"Yeah, I can also think about it. Maybe we can do a document and then we can discuss this on-",INT,F,SE1 11.30,
H,Put in the different categories we want.,EXT,F,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah. And then we can discuss this on Thursday.,INT,F,SE1 11.30,
G,Uh-huh.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
A,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"Okay, which document at the moment?",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"So are we going to split the different, um, tools?",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
G,Yes. I would prefer maybe EMODA. If you don't have any-,EXT,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"Yeah, sure you can do it ",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
G,Any wishes ,ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
A,I'm OK with whatever.,EXT,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"H, do you have any preferences? ",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
H,I think I kind of forgot so ,EXT,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"What was, uh, can I see the excel sheet again? I forgot (inaudible).",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"Yeah, right.",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
H,Maybe the first one? Is it the drop down- menu things?,ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"I can share again, wait a moment.",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"Yes, yes.",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
K,Here?,ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"Yeah. So you can move up. I think I was- I don't know- OK, I can do the first one then.",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"A, which one do you want to go with, this one? I'll just-",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
A,You pick. You can pick first and then…,EXT,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"Uh, then I would go with this one I think.",EXT,F,SE1 11.30,
A,OK.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
H,So you can do FROCOLE then.,ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
A,"OK, sounds good.",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
K,And what should we do with K?,ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
A,Ask him? In the- or- or just assign him one.,ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
H,Or he could work on the discussion?,ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"Yeah, yeah, that's true.",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
H,Or something?,ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
A,"Alright, 'cause we're- we're only going to do 3, right?",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"Wait, wait, sorry?",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
A,We're only doing 4 tools.,EXT,F,SE1 11.30,
H,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
A,"Yeah, OK. So then- yeah.",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
K,And then I will write this down here.,EXT,F,SE1 11.30,
G,I can suggest for him- to read again- our writing. And make it coherent.,EXT,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"OK, OK, yes.",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
A,"But umm. This is for like next week, right? Not the next meeting.",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"For next week, yeah.",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
A,"OK, but- so I think, uh, but Thursday we're going to be
meeting with, umm…",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
H,Essi.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"Essi, and uh, and ask some questions.",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
A,"So then yeah, by then, I'll also. I'll finish up my- like- final editing and stuff, and maybe add another paragraph or so to my- to the forms. And make it more coherent.",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"Sorry, I was- my Internet connection was bad. What did you say right now? ",ELI,,SE1 11.30,
A,"Uhm? No, I was just saying that by- by Thursday, I'll, like, finalize my part for the- the problems and challenges, yeah.",EXT,F,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
G,Uh-huh.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"(inaudible) we still have time. And by the way, I would like to let you know that on the… Let me see… Monday in a week. Uh, I won't be available until 13th of December because I will be in Lapland.",EXT,F,SE1 11.30,

G,"13, OK.",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"Yeah, there (inaudible).",QC,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"I think that we’ll be like- we are almost done already, so-",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
G,Yes.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
H,"I think on the- on that week just (inaudible) for the closing, right?",ELI,P,SE1 11.30,
K,On Friday 17th.,EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
H,"Yeah, I, I think it's the end of the course or something.",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
K,"Yeah, do we have to present anything for this course? Like
do a presentation about our article?",ELI,P,SE1 11.30,
G,I'm not sure.,EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
H,"Do they show in the- there was a document, in the front? Where I did the collaborative stage.",ELI,P,SE1 11.30,
K,"Sorry, what did you say, H?",ELI,P,SE1 11.30,
H,"Uh, in the collaborative stage the, the, the, like the course group. I think there was a document that shows, like, the different weeks, what's happening.",EXT,P,SE1 11.30,
K,Mhm.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
H,Maybe you can check whether they mentioned something about…,ELI,P,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 11.30,
G,"But I have one question, how K can analyze discussion and limitation without our- our analysis of tools?",ELI,F,SE1 11.30,
K,Umm? ,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"So, he has to do it later, I think.",EXT,F,SE1 11.30,
K,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
G,"But now, maybe- maybe he can read again the- our writing.",CON,F,SE1 11.30,
H,"Yeah, and then he can do uh- the, the pink parts, like the linking paragraphs.",INT,F,SE1 11.30,
G,Uh-huh.,QC,F,SE1 11.30,
K,"That's a good idea, yeah.",QC,F,SE1 11.30,

G,"Ah, OK, it's just- it's just a, it's just from one article?",ELI,P,SE1 12.02,
H,"Yes, so this article was analyzing different tools in some sense. But, umm, not- like some are more off, like, how do I say, like social regulation stuff.",QC,,SE1 12.02,
G,Mmm.,QC,,SE1 12.02,
K,Yeah.,QC,,SE1 12.02,
G,I thought that you analyzed all these articles.,EXT,P,SE1 12.02,
H,"Oh no, no no, I just copied from the bottom. There is a link at the bottom, yeah, this one. It's just what- regulating their emotions, but not on collaborative.",CON,P,SE1 12.02,
G,OK.,QC,P,SE1 12.02,
H,"Yeah, so I, I thought like the the- the- the first tab on
technological tools, those are a bit more relevant to
collaborative learning.",EXT,,SE1 12.02,
G,Yes.,QC,,SE1 12.02,
K,Yeah.,QC,,SE1 12.02,
H,"Yeah, that was (inaudible) ah, yeah, so ah. I haven't taken a look at the rubric, so we want to decide on the comparison rubric right?",ELI,F,SE1 12.02,
K,"Yeah, that would be a great idea.",QC,F,SE1 12.02,
G,Yes.,QC,F,SE1 12.02,
G,"But before we start a discussion, I want to ask K. In the last meeting I just briefly showed what we decided because you skipped this meeting.",CON,P,SE1 12.02,
KF,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 12.02,
G,"Uh, in the working paper we decided to choose four tools.",EXT,P,SE1 12.02,
KF,OK.,QC,P,SE1 12.02,
G,"Just a moment. And share it between us. And for you, we offered just to read the whole article and make it more coherent and cohesive.",EXT,P,SE1 12.02,
H,"So do we let him, umm, remove any parts that's not relevant? Do we- are we going to have another copy of this or something? Do you want to… Because when he does the edits, he might remove some parts that are not, that might be too long winded or something.",ELI,F,SE1 12.02,
G,Uh-huh.,QC,F,SE1 12.02,
H,So do we-,ELI,F,SE1 12.02,
K,Maybe just a comment in the paper and then we can discuss it between us on next Monday.,EXT,F,SE1 12.02,
H,OK.,QC,F,SE1 12.02,
KF,"OK, but will you be sending me the articles or something like that?",ELI,F,SE1 12.02,
H,What articles are you referring to?,ELI,F,SE1 12.02,
KF,"You said- come again, tell me that task again, I didn't quite get it.",EXT,F,SE1 12.02,
G,"Uh, so-",EXT,F,SE1 12.02,
K,(inaudible) our article and all the other parts that we already write it- wrote there.,EXT,F,SE1 12.02,
KF,"OK, OK, you mean what you've already written.",QC,F,SE1 12.02,
K,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 12.02,

K,Check it for coherence and the citation.,EXT,F,SE1 12.02,
KF,"Oh OK, OK.",QC,F,SE1 12.02,
K,"If it makes sense, or is- if there's something missing or
something too much, uhm, you can comment it in this, in this paper and then we can-",EXT,F,SE1 12.02,
KF,"Oh, OK.",QC,F,SE1 12.02,
K,discuss about it on Monday.,EXT,F,SE1 12.02,
KF,OK alright alright.,QC,F,SE1 12.02,
H,"(inaudible) in the green and the pink highlights part like linking paragraph. So you create a linking paragraph to
combine two, two piece- like you're supposed to sort out everything into a paper.",EXT,F,SE1 12.02,
KF,Alright alright.,QC,F,SE1 12.02,
G,"Uh, we- we just divide the task between us and firstly we choose four tools, not five. That's why we assign for you this more specific or different task.",EXT,F,SE1 12.02,
KF,"OK, OK, no problem.",QC,F,SE1 12.02,
G,If it's OK for you?,ELI,F,SE1 12.02,
KF,"Oh yeah, I'm good.",QC,F,SE1 12.02,
G,And then this is just… small protocol how we do it.  And thank you K for sharing this. ,EXT,F,SE1 12.02,
K,"Yeah, you're welcome.",QC,,SE1 12.02,
G,"Yeah yeah you- you- you, your rubric there (inaudible). ",QC,,SE1 12.02,
K,"Like you said, it's four e-learning tools, but maybe we can have some inspiration there. Or… yeah. ",EXT,,SE1 12.02,
G,"Uh.  As I see it, there are a lot of criteria, (inaudible), maybe more than 15?",ELI,,SE1 12.02,
K,"Yeah, it doesn't fit for all of them, so but.",CON,,SE1 12.02,
G,"Yes, that's why I thought maybe when we analyze, we use this, uh, rubric. I think it's really good, but just fill, uh, any elements that we can find or observe.",INT,F,SE1 12.02,
K,What do you mean by this?,ELI,F,SE1 12.02,
G,"For example, in a mode, I don't know exactly, but I imagine. I just go through this criteria scale is to use tech support and, uh, if I can't find scale, I just, uh, put some not available information, not development information. Next criteria. Easy to use? Yes, and put some argumentation. It works well because blah blah blah or next-",EXT,F,SE1 12.02,
K,Uh-huh.,QC,F,SE1 12.02,
G,"... criteria, check support. For me it's minor concerns because blah blah blah and the following criteria, accessibility.  Ah, I can't answer. I can't find answer to this. I put again not available, not available.",EXT,F,SE1 12.02,
K,"Mhm, mhm.",QC,F,SE1 12.02,
G,"Maybe some- might begin put in the Excel format, fill for each four tools. And if it's needed in the end, uh, we can delete some criteria if it's not applicable at all for four each tool.",EXT,F,SE1 12.02,
K,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 12.02,
G,"Or just mention it in the text. For example, as we analyzed four tools, uh, we notice that the technical side are not covered, blah blah blah, something like that.  I'm sorry it's my just- my- just my suggestion.",EXT,F,SE1 12.02,
K,"Uh, sorry I- I- my connection was bad. I didn't hear you at all.",EXT,OT,SE1 12.02,
G,(inaudible) OK. OK.,QC,,SE1 12.02,
H,"I think, like, in summary, what G mentioned was that she was- she suggested that we can take this whole excel of this whole sheets of- this whole excel sheet or- this whole or this rubric and she will go through each tool using this rubric.",INT,P,SE1 12.02,
G,Yes.,QC,P,SE1 12.02,
K,"Mhm, yeah.",QC,P,SE1 12.02,
H,"And I think there is good and bad about it. I said I think it can be, or- it can be a starting off point for us. But I think we need to look at what our focus was. The focus we want.",CON,P,SE1 12.02,
K,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 12.02,
H,"Because some of the things are more on the technological parts, like-",CON,P,SE1 12.02,
K,Yeah.,QC,P,SE1 12.02,
H,"Umm, how is it- No, what was the thing? Like the technology (inaudible) support and availability, so that's more like, um, involving- of course, it is important in terms of like your application, but so what? What is it that we want to look at is an important thing to (inaudible).",CON,P,SE1 12.02,
G,Ah.,QC,P,SE1 12.02,
H,Because we are looking at how it supports the emotional-,CON,P,SE1 12.02,
G,"Emotion regulation, yes.",QC,P,SE1 12.02,
H,"cause if it's not user friendly, nobody will use it and that affects the second point.",CON,,SE1 12.02,
G,Uh-huh.,QC,,SE1 12.02,
K,Yeah.,QC,,SE1 12.02,
H,"So we probably need a category about, um, the supporting
emotional regulation part.",EXT,F,SE1 12.02,
G,"Uh, you mean now choose some criteria from this that can support emotion regulation?",ELI,F,SE1 12.02,
H,"But I don't think there are any criteria that is about emotional regulation here, right?",CON,F,SE1 12.02,
G,"Uh, and- but you suggest to add-",CON,F,SE1 12.02,
H,"We need to clean it up. Uh, our own, uh, like how we analyze whether a tool is effective for emotional regulation. 
I think we can use some of this, but I don't know whether we want to go so detail into it.",CON,F,SE1 12.02,
G,Mhm.,QC,F,SE1 12.02,
H,"But I think yes, we can do it, one first round, we can go through all and then pick up, like- because I don't think we will have all the information for this because in all the articles they only briefly described the tool.",CON,F,SE1 12.02,
G,Uh-huh.,QC,F,SE1 12.02,
K,Mhm.,QC,F,SE1 12.02,
H,"We may not be able to know whether they have… technological supports it. The students don't know how to
use it or there's a breakdown. So if any information is not
mentioned then we don't have to talk about it at all. Yeah, so- so- my suggestion is that we can either, like, I do like what G suggested- ",CON,F,SE1 12.02,
G,Uh-huh.,QC,F,SE1 12.02,
H,"We do it comprehensively one time, but that's not the main aim. Let’s just name just some key points and we need to focus on the-",CON,F,SE1 12.02,
G,"Yes, you're right.",QC,F,SE1 12.02,
H,emotional regulation parts.,CON,F,SE1 12.02,
G,Uh-huh.,QC,F,SE1 12.02,
H,Otherwise we get distracted by the other parts.,CON,F,SE1 12.02,
K,"Yeah, and then it takes a lot of time. Then when we have to look at all the aspects, that's right.",QC,F,SE1 12.02,
G,"Yes, yeah, definitely right.",QC,F,SE1 12.02,
H,"Yeah. So looking at all the aspects, a brief run through
maybe like 10 minutes to look through and-",INT,F,SE1 12.02,
K,"Yeah, yeah.",QC,F,SE1 12.02,
H,(inaudible) and then we need to- Maybe we can think about the- I think our highlight is the emotional regulation parts.,INT,F,SE1 12.02,
G,Uh-huh.,QC,F,SE1 12.02,
K,Yeah. OK.,QC,F,SE1 12.02,
G,Definitely.,QC,F,SE1 12.02,
K,"Yeah, then, let's try what we can find until Monday. Then we-",EXT,F,SE1 12.02,
H,"Yes, (inaudible).",QC,F,SE1 12.02,
K,"can talk about it, yeah.",EXT,F,SE1 12.02,
H,And then next Monday we can come to- if we can write something. Of course I think we can start writing the description of the tool first.,EXT,F,SE1 12.02,
G,Uh-huh.,QC,F,SE1 12.02,
H,The goal is more of the analysis at heart.,EXT,F,SE1 12.02,
K,Yeah.,QC,F,SE1 12.02,
G,Yes.,QC,F,SE1 12.02,
H,So then we come together on Monday to talk about what other cri- like our selected criterias.,EXT,F,SE1 12.02,
G,Uh-huh.,QC,F,SE1 12.02,

something that I can convert it into Excel file, so I’ll see if it works.",ELI,P,SE1 12.02,

G,"I can suggest for example, uh, now as I see, we represents short description about tools, except with- this is my highlighted yellow and later in analysis and results we can for example, used our rubrics and go for proof this. For

regulation criteria.",,P,SE1 12.06,QC

A,Mhm.,,P,SE1 12.06,QC

better where we straight away talk about the analysis right
after the tool, right?",,P,SE1 12.06,ELI

H,"OK. So shall we share the, let me share the screen. I haven't looked at it in the morning, so I think K has done a over. You have read through the whole thing right? because I saw some comments.",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
K,"Yeah I just, uh, scroll through and just skim, skimed it a little bit and there were some some things that I found so I just commented it. But nothing serious.",INT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,And add the sources I forgot to put down here the source. OK.,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Uh-huh,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
K,"Ah, I also wanted to say that I haven't finished my part, so emotional regulation part is missing, but I will do it today. So yeah. Just to let you know.",EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,I see.,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
A,"Uh, my my part is not there?",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"Yeah, OK, so will you be able to do today or something?",ELI,F,SE1 12.09,
A,"No, no, no I have I have like it all written.",EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,Oh you mean like somewhere else?,ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
A,"Wait, let me, no, I have it written in in the working paper, but I don't know why it didn't sync. How do I sync? One second. Let me copy and paste it now.",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Uh-huh,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
A,I don't know why…(H laughing) And I I had it added like. This early this morning.,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,Okay,QC,,SE1 12.09,
G,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 12.09,
A,One second,EXT,,SE1 12.09,
H,No worries.,QC,,SE1 12.09,
A,"Basically I used the... like websites, uh, as a reference, 'cause I could be, I would. I struggled to find any…",EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,Article right? (laughing),ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
A,"Yeah, and I even asked like I asked Marija, who's one of the tutors.",QC,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Uh,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
A,And she just told me to use the website basically.,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
K,"Yeah, I think that's fine.",QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,Yeah,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
G,I think it's good that we have different sources.,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
A,Uh,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
G,It's not necessary to use only articles.,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
K,Yeah,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"Yeah, so we'll wait for you to put it up. Meanwhile, let's look from the top. If there's anything we want to. How do I get rid of the comments when it's resolved? Because it's a bit different from Google document. Do you know how to like close it or something?",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
K,Just click on the three dots.,EXT,,SE1 12.09,
H,"Ah OK, OK. Wait, I didn't (inaudible) okey never mind.",QC,,SE1 12.09,
H,"OK, I see. Okay you suggested the right there in italics.",ELI,,SE1 12.09,
K,It's just a suggestion from we don't have to do it.,EXT,,SE1 12.09,
H,Yeah,QC,,SE1 12.09,
G,"I think it's more integrated in a text then and not that highlighted that much, what is happening.",EXT,,SE1 12.09,
H,"I wanted to highlight it, but I didn't know what to put so I used bold (inaudible).",EXT,,SE1 12.09,
K,Yeah,QC,,SE1 12.09,
H,"Because I thought at back we can all relate back to how each tool like helps, in which state of emotional regulation.",EXT,,SE1 12.09,
K,Yep,QC,,SE1 12.09,
H,So maybe that might help. Do we need to have a partly talks about like self regulation and shared regulation?,ELI,F,SE1 12.09,
G,No,EXT,F,SE1 12.09,
K,You mean the literature review or where?,ELI,F,SE1 12.09,
H,"Yeah, I don't know. Or is oh we can just leave it without it?",QC,F,SE1 12.09,
K,Hmm,EXT,F,SE1 12.09,
H,Do afterwards (inaudible) related to that? ,ELI,F,SE1 12.09,
A,Uhm,EXT,F,SE1 12.09,
G,Should we cover all questions regarding emotion to regulation?,ELI,F,SE1 12.09,
H,Where is our research question?,ELI,F,SE1 12.09,
K,"I mean, this is also something that we can do after the peer review.",CON,F,SE1 12.09,
H,Yeah,QC,F,SE1 12.09,
K,"If the others tell us that we should do it, then we can…",CON,F,SE1 12.09,
G,Yes! I agree.,QC,F,SE1 12.09,
H,"We can look at it again. Yeah, that's true. So we haven't agreed on this paragraph right? We are going to put the research question. I think we haven't decided if we are going to put it here or on top.",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
K,"Didn't we put it on top I there? Somewhere there, I thought there were.",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
H,Emotional regulation.,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
K,Ah OK.,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
G,So should we also at our aim of this article.,ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
H,Is that the research question or aim?,ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Aim. It's different than research question. I think it's more general.,CON,P,SE1 12.09,
H,Okay.,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
A,Sorry can you just check if you can see my part now? (smiling),ELI,,SE1 12.09,
H,"OK, let me just check...Yeah, it's here.",QC,,SE1 12.09,
A,OK cool.,QC,,SE1 12.09,
H,Yeah (laughing),QC,,SE1 12.09,
G,Good good.,QC,,SE1 12.09,
K,Yeah,QC,,SE1 12.09,
H,"Yeah it is in OK yeah, OK, so let's go back to the question of the research question and the aim right?",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
K,Yeah,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Yes,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"OK, so let me scroll it back here. We emphasize...So what would we say is the aim? To investigate how the tools, how some of the existing tools can regulate? This one?",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Maybe yes.,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
K,Yeah,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Uh-huh,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"But if we like specifically, say the aim again, would it be a repetition or this thing again? Or we just again (inaudible)",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
G,"I think I think no, we just make some part coherently. (laughing)",CON,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"OK, yeah, we just need to smoothen the flow, right?",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
K,Uh,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Yes,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
K,"So what do you think about when we just first put the aim, then referred to that's because we would like to answer these research questions. So after the aim, we put the research questions and then we describe how we how our article is structured.",INT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"OK, I think that sounds logical.",QC,P,SE1 12.09,
A,Yeah,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Uh-huh,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,So that means our research question will be up here before we talk about emotion and emotional regulation.,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
K,Yeah,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"So shift it up. Then the next question is about... let me just move this first.
OK, so we need to maybe like smoothen our research questions like are we are we really going to talk about the roles of teachers and students?",CON,P,SE1 12.09,
G,"It's not the role, actually it's…ummm",CON,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"Or we can make it a little more general, like how that…umm",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
G,How teachers can facilitate?,ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"Yeah, like something like the last one.",QC,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Uh-huh,ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
H,How teachers can facilitate…how teachers can use these tools?,ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Use! Yes yes!,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
A,Because…,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
G,And how students can use these tools.,INT,P,SE1 12.09,
A,"Yeah, 'cause we have that as part of our like analysis.",EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"Yeah, teacher",QC,P,SE1 12.09,
A,Teacher usage and yeah.,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,Ah...or regulation right?,ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
A,How many page is this…25…,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,Like that?,ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Yes.,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"Well, these other two main question.",EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
G,"So we have only….Yes, I think it's enough. I'm not sure, maybe Essi can comment us, but we'll see.",EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,So we'll have the aim here.,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Article? Or study?,ELI,,SE1 12.09,
H,Study to…,EXT,,SE1 12.09,
K,But is it a study? I would prefer the word article.,CON,,SE1 12.09,
A,You're right.,QC,,SE1 12.09,
H,Article is to identify….analyze…some….,INT,,SE1 12.09,
G,Existed,INT,,SE1 12.09,
H,Existing some technological tools?,INT,,SE1 12.09,
A,In the context of,INT,,SE1 12.09,
H,In the context of?,INT,,SE1 12.09,
A,Collaborative learning,INT,,SE1 12.09,
H,Ah yeah,QC,,SE1 12.09,
K,Yeah,QC,,SE1 12.09,
H,Collaborative learning…,INT,,SE1 12.09,
A,And emotional regulation I guess.,INT,,SE1 12.09,
G,Yes. That can support emotion regulation and it's have already,INT,,SE1 12.09,
H,Yeah…(inaudible) something like that?,ELI,,SE1 12.09,
A,Yeah cool.,QC,,SE1 12.09,
H,And we would so so our article set out to answer these two questions?,ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
K,Yeah,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
A,"Maybe I don't know if this is too much more like yeah, firstly like what tools exist and then how these tools will take you know how teachers and students can use these tools?",CON,P,SE1 12.09,
K,"So we put it in text on writing, instead of uh, aspect one aspect two or what do you suggest?",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
H,Or you mean like this?,ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
A,"I mean, I don't know actually.",QC,P,SE1 12.09,
K,"Yeah, but that's that's good.",QC,P,SE1 12.09,
A,"I kind of like the one and two, but,",CON,P,SE1 12.09,
H,So is it?,ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
K,Yeah. We can also make…,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"And also you mentioned like one more question is what tools are existing, is that right?",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
A,"Yeah, like, but I guess there should be first first question…like",CON,P,SE1 12.09,
G,"Ah...I have a counter argument, sorry A",CON,P,SE1 12.09,
A,Yeah,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
G,"Because we didn't review all tools, we just select severals.",CON,P,SE1 12.09,
A,That's true.,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,So I think this is fine.,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
G,And we don't know.,CON,P,SE1 12.09,
H,The bigger question?,ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
A,OK.,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Sorry,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
A,"No no no no, I (inaudible) it's cool",QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,Okay,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
A,Actually makes sense.,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"Uh…in this article….…teachers...Yeah, yeah, I think this is almost done. Let me just…so little weird here…just...",EXT,,SE1 12.09,
K,Okay.,QC,,SE1 12.09,
H,"Emotional….. Okay, is this alright?",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
K,Uh-huh,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"Then we go into emotional regulation emotions and emotional regulation and then OK. OK, so this is done resolve. Just thought I had this (inaudible) somewhere.... followed by teacher's role and student's role...OK.
And after talking about the teacher's and student's role in enhancing collaboration, do we need to have a part about leading to technological tools that we mentioned about technological tool somewhere?",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
G,"Maybe in methodology. I think we need to write more about our methodology and how we choose tools.
For example randomly with random limited resource, and describe rubrics.",INT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,Actually we found some articles right and then we specifically chose those who are which are more related to emotional regulation rather than self regulation.,CON,P,SE1 12.09,
A,Yeah,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"Those aspects of emotional regulation in relation to collaborative aspect with some collaboration context, right? So we have to talk about our how we chose the tools, right? ",INT,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Yes,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,The four tools from the article…we filter out specifically…tools which are….rather than self-regulation...,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Emotion regulation.,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"Because there is a nice kind which is more on like cognitive part. How does it facilitate the cognitive discussion parts. Because we had a few tools, right? Do you remember?",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Uh-huh,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"And also as the context….
Yeah, two parts we need to add in like how we choose these tools...",INT,P,SE1 12.09,
G,At learning contexts,INT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,And the other one is the rubrics…,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Rubrics,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
K,Rubric,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"where we going to have rubrics, and then how we we filter out. We we remove those that were not so relevant.",EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
A,Uh-huh,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
G,"And you asked questions or comments regarding should be mentioned about emotion regulation, yes. Can you please open yes uh-huh.",INT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"I think I put it at a different part, right?",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Yeah,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"I think I wanted to put out OK, so I wanted to say for each of our part regarding emotional regulation, maybe we can see whether it can be linked to the the front part where we mentioned like there are the four different strategies of emotional regulation, right?",INT,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Uh-huh,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,So that there is a link between our literature review and where we analyze the tools.,INT,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Uh-huh,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
A,Uh-huh,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"Yeah, but if there is, it doesn't like it it it operates differently from it doesn't like do all these four (inaudible) is fine as well, we just don't mention. But if it gets a certain form of emotional regulation strategy that is this for we can talk a bit about it maybe.",CON,P,SE1 12.09,
K,"So you mean just to add two to three sentences, which explains which regulations?",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"Yeah, like the emotion regulation give your tool that one of those things we can just say like okay which is response modulation which is a form of it, which is one of the emotional regulation strategy or something like.",INT,P,SE1 12.09,
K,Yeah I think this is a good idea.,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,Yeah okay so how?,ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
K,Let's mark here and yeah.,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Uh-huh,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"OK, so we just need to add this part, yeah. And also you were saying that technological tools, right? So I bring this down to.",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Uh-huh,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"I think it's just a a short flow like short small a few sentences to smoothen or flow about, like why we are looking at technological tools.",EXT,,SE1 12.09,
A,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 12.09,
H,I'm not sure if it should be under methodology or still in the introduction.,CON,,SE1 12.09,
K,Maybe after the emotion and emotion regulation part?,ELI,,SE1 12.09,
H,So you mean here? Then how does it link to the part where we talk about the different roles of feature sets?,CON,,SE1 12.09,
K,Hmm true.,QC,,SE1 12.09,
G,Maybe after different roles of teachers.,ELI,,SE1 12.09,
H,"So yeah, I was thinking maybe after this we can say something like with the like advancement in technology so like there might be some tools that can replace the need of teachers having to do or this and tools that can facilitate or something like that.",INT,,SE1 12.09,
K,Mmm,QC,,SE1 12.09,
H,"Along those lines, I don't know how to. How to (inaudible) our story (laughing)? Because this part was about how teachers…. emotional co-regulation. Do we have any ideas?",ELI,,SE1 12.09,
A,Yeah.,QC,,SE1 12.09,
G,Here need more specified define of maybe digital age?,ELI,,SE1 12.09,
A,Yeah,QC,,SE1 12.09,
G,that we are right now. ,ELI,,SE1 12.09,
A,"With the lack of face to face interaction, tools are maybe needed more to compensate for that. (smiling)",INT,,SE1 12.09,
H,"Sorry, can you repeat that again? Is broken on my side.",ELI,,SE1 12.09,
A,"As G was saying, like with the more digitalization and like as a education, especially because of the pandemic like, it's not face to face anymore. So to compensate for the yeah, the lack of face to face interaction. Maybe? (smiling)",INT,,SE1 12.09,
H,We can talk about the move to online learning.,EXT,,SE1 12.09,
A,Yeah,QC,,SE1 12.09,
H,"The um, (inaudible) for online collaboration. So in the absence of teachers, how does we will need to rely, we will need to look at. So we need to explore how technological tools can help something like that?",ELI,,SE1 12.09,
A,Yeah,QC,,SE1 12.09,
H,OK sounds good!,QC,,SE1 12.09,
G,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 12.09,
A,"I like that FROCOLE, I mean, an overview of ratings and stuff so. For example, a teacher, they can, I mean, I kind of wrote that in my part already, but interesting, kind of oversee different scores of students and like, intervene or give positive feedback, if needed, whatever.",EXT,,SE1 12.09,
K,Yeah sounds good.,QC,,SE1 12.09,
G,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 12.09,
A,But so this part doesn't need to be so.,CON,,SE1 12.09,
H,"Yeah, it's just a short part, so I think, uh, the possibilities…",QC,,SE1 12.09,
G,"Like these, yes like one maybe.",QC,,SE1 12.09,
A,"And just so I understand correctly, like the draft is due Tuesday?",ELI,F,SE1 12.09,
H,Yeah that's right,QC,F,SE1 12.09,
G,Yes,QC,F,SE1 12.09,
K,Yeah yeah,QC,F,SE1 12.09,
A,And then I guess we got feedback and then finalize it by Wednesday for that.,EXT,F,SE1 12.09,

G,"Or just my, down and after that, decide.",EXT,F,SE1 12.09,
H,I don't know why is your connection? Is it my connection?,ELI,,SE1 12.09,
K,G can you repeat?,ELI,,SE1 12.09,
G,"I just suggested scroll down, look through all work and after that decide.",EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"Yeah, OK, so we can read together or some…I'll scroll down.",QC,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Scroll down I guess.,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"I read, I brieafly read through. ",EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Thank you K for comments.,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
K,Yes sure,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,Okay I'll add mine too. Let me just…where is my source…,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
G,What do you want?,ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"I just add my sauce to, I didn't add mine so. This one we need to change later on, right?",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Yes,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,OK. I was thinking whether do we need so many details for this part?,ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Do you suggest to make more shorter?,ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"Yeah, I'm I'm not sure if the rest felt this way.",CON,P,SE1 12.09,
K,"Well, I think we should leave it and then wait for the peer comments. If they say it's too much because we can always delete, but we can't add (laughing)",CON,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Yes okay okay.,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,Yes that's true.,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
K,Then we will see.,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,OK sure no problem. OK. Are you reading or I don't know whetehr I scroll down (laughing),QC,P,SE1 12.09,
K,"Uhm, I think we should maybe split the the parts where we already highlighted between us.",CON,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"OK, let's OK. So so when we talk about we go through the whole thing, then we see whether there's any more yellow path so.",INT,P,SE1 12.09,
K,"Ah, okay.",QC,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Yes.,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"So all our individual parts, maybe we can read through again and give comments or something.",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
K,"Yeah yeah, good idea.",QC,P,SE1 12.09,
A,Yeah,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"Yeah, so we want to do that at our own time or not. Now right? We go through the other parts.",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
G,"Yes, after this.",QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,So this part okay (inaudible),EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
A,"Uhm, I need to write…",EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
G,"Uh, what's your comment?",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
A,I still need to write some the cognitive presence part. But like a bit.,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,Okay,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
A,"Confused, I don't know if like what exactly like cognitive presence is? I don't know. Can someone give a example?",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"Uh definition, yeah. Because we also have to write that under the rubrics we have to define what this functionality, what it means, right?",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
K,Don't you think that we can refer to the sheet that I sent? Or did I uploaded?,ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"Yeah, we can use the...uh, so I think for cognitive presence it means how it facilitates, like their metacognition that thinking box, how does it facilitate. I think it was more on the case of like in Moodle, how does it facilitate discussion that can help generate knowledge.",INT,,SE1 12.09,
A,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 12.09,
G,Or higher order thinking.,INT,,SE1 12.09,
A,"Yeah, so like I would imagine this part would need like some more concrete, like scientific references behind it. Right?",ELI,,SE1 12.09,
K,Not really. You can just leave it general.,CON,,SE1 12.09,
H,"Yeah, I I wrote it by generally I talk about like how the the scripts support their reflection and maybe a bit more. Just like yeah and my thinking through this increases their metacognition of their emotions or something like that.",INT,,SE1 12.09,
A,Got it.,QC,,SE1 12.09,
K,"And if you can't find any information, you can just yeah.",EXT,,SE1 12.09,
A,General,EXT,,SE1 12.09,
K,"Yeah, make it like it can be that they have. They can see the other information, but we actually don't know so just.",EXT,,SE1 12.09,
G,Uh-huh,QC,,SE1 12.09,
A,"OK, so I'll I'll add a few sentences really.",EXT,F,SE1 12.09,
H&K&G,Yeah,QC,F,SE1 12.09,
A,Alright thank you,QC,,SE1 12.09,
H,"OK so...OK, so we'll… OK, so then we have to come to this part.",EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
K,Yeah,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
G,"Ah, by the way, can I share my screen?",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
H,Oh yeah sure.,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
G,"I just want to suggest you maybe regarding the rubrics.
Ah, we just view like small table tables where our tools are right now. Uh, S-REG, FROCOLE, SEST for example.
It's works well, minor or serious concerns like in the initial tables like this. What do you think? Should we feel it or not or skip it?",ELI,,SE1 12.09,
A,"Like add this, like fill it and add it to the paper?",ELI,,SE1 12.09,
G,"Yes, like a like our results that we analyzed this tools and the, uh, categorized, so each each categories. Uh, how it works well or not so good.",EXT,,SE1 12.09,
K,"I get your point, but I'm not sure if we have this much information about it. So do we really want to grade them? If they are good tools or not, such such good tools. So if do we really want to grade it like this?",CON,,SE1 12.09,
H,Yeah..we just…(inaudible),QC,,SE1 12.09,
K,Or do you just want to observe the the the rubrics in general? But that's the question that arises for me.,ELI,,SE1 12.09,
H,Yeah,QC,,SE1 12.09,
G,Okay,QC,,SE1 12.09,
H,"Because I think most of the tools we like, we don't have a whole manual the tool, so it might be hard to look at in this way, and our grading may not be very accurate or like relevant, so like. We wanted to see how it supports, right? So our option was about emotional regulation, so it's usage and staff may not, as in it is a good way to evaluate, but like maybe we can just focus our energy on like the emotional parts.",CON,,SE1 12.09,
K,Yeah,QC,,SE1 12.09,
G,Yes yes definetly.,QC,,SE1 12.09,
H,"So that we don't get stressed? Yeah, because eventually all paper is not an evaluation of tools, but rather like more of how like how it helps like other professors to lead to emotional regulation.",CON,,SE1 12.09,
K,Yeah,QC,,SE1 12.09,
G,Okay,QC,,SE1 12.09,
H,For a discussion and how is KF going to do all? Or how would you like to do that part? We want to write down some points like short points now or something.,ELI,F,SE1 12.09,
A,Yeah maybe like a structure.,QC,F,SE1 12.09,
H,Yes,QC,F,SE1 12.09,
K,Yeah structure.,QC,F,SE1 12.09,
H,Okay since we are…,EXT,F,SE1 12.09,
K,"KF, have you already thought about it? What can we, what can we write in the discussion or the limitations?",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
KF,"Uh, yeah yesterday I was reading going through the EMODA tool yeah. So I'm yet to read about the next, uh, the subsequent ones.",EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
K,But do you already have some ideas? so we can conclude this?,ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
KF,"How we can conclude it, no no no no no not yet.",CON,P,SE1 12.09,
G,"I think we should start with general explanation, but we have chosen different tools.",INT,P,SE1 12.09,
K,Yeah,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Specifying different,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,(inaudible). You're talking about discussion?,ELI,,SE1 12.09,
G,Yes,QC,,SE1 12.09,
K,Yeah,QC,,SE1 12.09,
H,Okay.,QC,,SE1 12.09,
K,"So guys, do you mind if I just switch off my camera and start to pack a little bit because I have to leave in half an hour and I will listen to it.",ELI,,SE1 12.09,
G,Okay,QC,,SE1 12.09,
H,Yeah no problem! You just do your own thing.,QC,,SE1 12.09,
K,Okay,QC,,SE1 12.09,
H,"And then you can help me once. So we were saying, G, you were saying that to (inaudible)?",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
G,"Yes. Just describe generally we have chosen four tools from different perspectives. Uhm...for example, EMODA is more for teachers, ah, SEST more for students, yes?",INT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,Yes,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Collaboration? Just highlighted.,INT,P,SE1 12.09,
A,"And maybe…or maybe we don't have to write like necessarily the pros and cons of each tool, but like.",CON,P,SE1 12.09,
H,A general yeah,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
A,"Yeah, general like what maybe pick one tool that we find particularly like convincing and one tool that maybe is is lacking.",INT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,Okay,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
A,Or something like that.,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"Then we suggest that we can integrate the strength of each two into a better tool, something like that?",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
A,Yeah,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,We can talk about the (inaudible) what limitations of? Sorry I forgot…and integrating strengths of the better tool.,EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
A,"Actually, I think I wrote.",EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,You wrote some?,ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
A,"Like I wrote, the limitation of FROCOLE, maybe I shouldn't have put it. Maybe that should go in the discussion and limitations.",INT,P,SE1 12.09,
G,"I think no, it's normal. KF can summarize our just and repeat it again, I think.",CON,P,SE1 12.09,
A,Yep,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Because I wrote also limitations.,CON,P,SE1 12.09,
A,"And then if you have anything after the review, maybe we get told just to mention it once at the end or OK.",EXT,P,SE1 12.09,
H,Maybe just so we don't elaboration (inaudible). That's all about OK like one of the like the main limitation mentioned about EMODA is a certain thing. As for (inaudible) for a certain thing and then the other one is a certain thing. So like can we do about all these limitations. And the the strength about each tool. Something like that.,CON,,SE1 12.09,
A,Yeah,QC,,SE1 12.09,
H,"OK, the limitations. Do we have to talk about limitations of our study as well? Of this article or just limitation of the tools?",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
G,"Yeah yes yes, maybe like, uh our study is just review four tools, not so much. Randome selection.",QC,P,SE1 12.09,
K,"And that we also didn't have that much information about the tools, so we aren't experts in this tool. We should definitely talk about this.",INT,,SE1 12.09,
G,"Rely on on some articles, yes.",INT,,SE1 12.09,
A,Yeah good point.,QC,,SE1 12.09,
G,"And then unfortunately, we don't have personal experience, except for FROCOLE to use these tools.",INT,,SE1 12.09,
K,Yeah yeah,QC,,SE1 12.09,
A,"Yeah….Guys, uh, I'll have to leave in like 5 minutes.",EXT,,SE1 12.09,
H,"Alright, OK, I think we are good. Uh, maybe we can set another meeting on, we are, are we going to look through again before Tuesday?
",ELI,F,SE1 12.09,
A,"Yeah, I think we should.",QC,F,SE1 12.09,
G,Monday?,ELI,F,SE1 12.09,
A,"But depending on, I guess KF.",EXT,F,SE1 12.09,
H,Yeah,QC,F,SE1 12.09,
A,Maybe…,EXT,F,SE1 12.09,
H,"(inaudible) Monday meetings, right?",ELI,F,SE1 12.09,
A,"Yeah, maybe we should (inaudible)",QC,F,SE1 12.09,
H,"Like in the Monday meeting whether KF, I think it should be possible to get that done?",ELI,F,SE1 12.09,
KF,On Monday yep.,QC,F,SE1 12.09,
H,Yeah by before our meeting and then we can read through?,ELI,F,SE1 12.09,
A,Yeah ,QC,F,SE1 12.09,
KF,Yeah,QC,F,SE1 12.09,
H,"Either carry together or if we have time, if there is time for, yeah, then we can read through 1st and we can like see if there's anything else to add or change.",EXT,F,SE1 12.09,
A,Yeah,QC,F,SE1 12.09,
H,Okay so the yellow parts we didn't split right?,ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
G,"Yes, you need to split it right now in three minutes.",QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"Actually, just this, this short paragraph and also there are only these three parts actually, right?",ELI,P,SE1 12.09,
A,Uh,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
G,Uh-huh,QC,P,SE1 12.09,
H,"And this I can just get it from the Excel sheet. Ah, how I think K doesn't have time to do so. It's fine, so.",EXT,F,SE1 12.09,
A,I can do like the…,EXT,F,SE1 12.09,
H,The first one?,ELI,F,SE1 12.09,
A,"Yeah, possibilities of.",QC,F,SE1 12.09,
H,"Just you mentioned this right? OK, so you can do this then maybe like either G or I can do this part.",ELI,F,SE1 12.09,
G, It doesn't matter for me. Just just for me either. (lauhging),EXT,F,SE1 12.09,
H,Okay so.,QC,F,SE1 12.09,
K,I could maybe I could do the rubrics if you like. I can focus on that.,ELI,F,SE1 12.09,
G,"I could do first, why we choose, why we have chosen.",EXT,F,SE1 12.09,
H,"Yeah okay. So this is. You know the article and article is, I think I put it in there, put it in the Excel sheet. Yeah, but anyways, fine, I'll put it here as well. So I think we should be all right now?",ELI,R,SE1 12.09,

KF,Alright okay.,QC,,SE1 12.09,
H,"Yeah, and you can just add the things on top. Or maybe I create another version of the paper like a duplicate?
Would that be good? Or we just leave KF to do the edit on for any parts.",ELI,F,SE1 12.09,
A,I don't think duplicating is….,CON,F,SE1 12.09,
H,"OK, so we don't need to keep a copy, it's fine. Yeah, so I think it's alright. You just add it as you think it's suitable.",INT,F,SE1 12.09,

H,They didn't give an instruction on that right how the thing is.,EXT,F,SE1 12.16,
A,"I think they said to create a separeate tab, let me double check.",EXT,F,SE1 12.16,

G,Mhm,QC,,SE1 12.16,
H,Technology implications. Maybe this is the aim.,EXT,,SE1 12.16,
K,Yeah,QC,,SE1 12.16,
A,But yeah it appears on page eight paper.,QC,,SE1 12.16,
H,Yeah,QC,,SE1 12.16,
A,Maybe it has to be...,EXT,,SE1 12.16,
H,"Maybe in the abstract they could, did they mention anything in the abstract? Futher, paper elaboration and regulation for teacher support…hmm. Maybe just mentioning clear goals and also it's earlier on.",EXT,,SE1 12.16,

I think it's nice that they mentioned like the challenges in collaborative learning in relation to frustration.",EXT,,SE1 12.16,

H,"OK, let's go back to the or if you one of you can say out the... I think first one was about the aims, right?  Whether it's clearly (inaudible).",ELI,,SE1 12.16,
G,"The second one, how do the authors succeed to reach the aim they said.",EXT,,SE1 12.16,
H,"OK, so we need to see whether they answer their research question, which is, it's got the page 8. Alright. So did they answer the question of the features in online learning that?

G,Yes,QC,,SE1 12.16,
H,"Maybe either just before they answer, maybe under analysis or something here, yeah?",ELI,,SE1 12.16,
H,"Is for the tools. Yeah, they focus on awareness of emotional, about emotional awareness, right? There was the main  features they were looking at emotional awareness tools.",ELI,,SE1 12.16,

K,Yeah,QC,,SE1 12.16,
H,"So that maybe we can say that paper focuses on emotional awareness tools…you can change…how does…in the aspect of….only one feature was mentioned . Okay.

Are we done with the part about whether they answer their aims? Any other things that we want to bring out?

I like the part about the emotional awareness how they 
brought up, elaborated on it. That was quite clear.",EXT,P,SE1 12.16,
G,Mhm,QC,P,SE1 12.16,
G,"Okay, next question, how do the authors use theoretical 
knowledge in the article? What is the role of their own reflection.",ELI,,SE1 12.16,
H,"So in other words, how do they? Ohh make use of how do they apply theoretical knowledge?",INT,,SE1 12.16,
G,And own reflection,INT,,SE1 12.16,
H,I'm not sure how to comment about this. They do mentioned about like the different types of strategies and also the regulation self regulation.,ELI,,SE1 12.16,

So how shall I, is it you were saying good connection between...good use of theoretical knowldge in relation to your...the examples given and also the personal experience of...description relating to your...

H,Okay,QC,,SE1 12.16,

G,Mhm,QC,,SE1 12.16,
A,So I think unless you guys have any other comments we already.,EXT,,SE1 12.16,
H,"I agree with you. I think in the general flow was quite good, like it's quite logical. I could follow what they are trying to bring to. Yeah, maybe they just have to reorganize the parts about or like how do they want to bring in the teacher role and the tools.",QC,,SE1 12.16,
K&A,Yeah,QC,,SE1 12.16,
H,Okay so maybe we can still like…after introduction…I think that's the main comments?,ELI,,SE1 12.16,

H,Articles…let's look at,EXT,,SE1 12.16,
G,They are relevant.,EXT,,SE1 12.16,

Even need a table of this, of the different roles? This was a nice summary of the teacher, what teachers can do?",ELI,,SE1 12.16,

AS,"Yeah, yeah. I think, I think if we because I I have a feeling that if like for like like if I look up internal and external scripts, there's gonna be something about fading in that and if you look up dating you're gonna see something. So I think if we all kind of chose one of these because I think they're all related and then we decide to look it up considering each other's topics in mind and we can come back together and then find a focus amongst what we've, what we've researched.

Yeah, scripts. Yeah, there's a bunch here.",,F,SC1 11.10,CON

AI,Ohh no I don't. I'm confused now.,,F,SC1 11.10,Q
AS,"OK, So what we've done so far, we just created a a a page in our teams, in our scripting one teams that have this information that AI's displaying 'cause these are the questions and that we are supposed to consider in the 45 minutes we've been together. We kind of thought it was interesting to maybe focus on internal versus external scripts and fading and you know what kind of script meet we could potentially use to allow for fading in a CSCL environment. And then and then what we were doing now we were looking to see if there was academic articles from at least within the last five years that we could use to discuss this. And the one that you saw when you came in was what AI found about freshmen and whatever it was. ",,,SC1 11.10,ELI
AI,Something that. The idea so far is that we'll like choose some studies to read. We'll try to read them for the next time and then by next time we wAI like figure out the solid question.,,,SC1 11.10,
EN,So any question.,,,SC1 11.10,Q
LC,"Guys. I just had an idea we should make like a review or like we could actually that could be published a review of information. And the question could be like, like the tendencies of like the last five years or the advanced is compared like through other reviews. Like you do.",,,SC1 11.10,EXT
AI,You want to make the overview right?,,,SC1 11.10,EXT
LC,"Yeah, like analyze several articles.  Looking for specific keywords and get from their categories of analysis and then write a conclusion about it. Like a discussion, a conclusion about it.",,R,SC1 11.10,EXT
AI,"You mean like the edit tech homework we have for this week, right?",,R,SC1 11.10,Q
LC,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Something like that.",,R,SC1 11.10,EXT
AI,"So we just had homework this week, which was like, which was like reading an article where someone created an overview. So it just seems very similar.",,F,SC1 11.10,ELI
AS,Yeah,,F,SC1 11.10,ELI
LC,"Yeah. And the question could be based on that, like, which differences can we find or which analysis categories can we find or something like that. That's easy to do, That's useful, actually, And that can actually be published.",,F,SC1 11.10,Q
AS,"Yeah, that's true. But I wonder, like, are we limited though? Like because we're supposed to do like five? I think if we're gonna do a review, we'd have to look at like, tons of them, like like the one in the article they they looked at 107 articles like, and they narrowed it down to 37.",,F,SC1 11.10,EXT
LC,"Yeah. That's why we should like, define categories like the specific keywords and then just start selecting all the articles we can get. It doesn't matter how many, just to just to well, just to altogether. And then once we've written not the whole article, just the abstract, we can start getting an idea of what could be useful or not and then applying other exclusion criteria. So because something like that. And then we will have to read it all twenty articles, we can just analyze them with a I know analytical tool like how do you call that a good name they're yeah, the best softwares that do that.",,,SC1 11.10,ELI
AI,That's…So you want our main aim or our question to be like what's the current situation on the market kind of?,,,SC1 11.10,Q
LC,"I mean that's yeah, I yeah, I proposed that personally.",,OT,SC1 11.10,Q
AS,It sounds like a lot of work to me.,,F,SC1 11.10,EXT
AI,Personally #2 it sounds like not I I get what you're saying like it would be a little bit easier for us because we wouldn't really have to think that much. We just have to like collect the data. But I don't know if that would be interesting or in the like what we're supposed to do here. I don't know.,,F,SC1 11.10,Q
LC,Because it's only six weeks. I mean we don't have time to to collect other kind of data.,,OT,SC1 11.10,EXT
AI,We can't really do real research paper. But I don't know if that's.,,OT,SC1 11.10,Q
AS,"Yeah, I agree with AI. I think it it. I think it takes away from the aim of what we're trying to to do.
Like I think maybe I don't. I don't think and I also don't think it's necessarily always a bad thing to kind of challenge ourselves a little bit to kinda push. I don't know, HA, EN, what do you guys think? You haven't said anything.",,OT,SC1 11.10,EXT
EN,Ohh Well I I think it's well the when she brought that up I was in my head. I was beginning to imagine if we're gonna do some sort of research then maybe like a survey to answer some of the questions we come up with. I just a bit stresses scared about as to how intense we might go and then again we don't have so much time and really I don't know how we can make this work without getting to gets into spend so much time Really.,,OT,SC1 11.10,EXT
HA,"Yeah. What I am thinking is just thinking both we have pros and cons and I'm not sure but like if I have to choose One direction I won't prepare like um have our own my question uh is the question and yeah, yeah.",,OT,SC1 11.10,EXT
AS,I'm gonna have to agree. Sorry LC.,,,SC1 11.10,
LC,"OK. No, it's fine.",,,SC1 11.10,
EN,"And also,",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,Yeah,,,SC1 11.10,
LC,Just to clarify we should then make some sort of experiment or questionnaire or focus group or something collect the data,,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"No, no, no, no. There's no way we have time for that.",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,Can we just use that just ,,,SC1 11.10,
LC,"That's what that's what I'm telling you. Then what? Like, if we're gonna make a question but we won't be able to answer it, then we should go for something that we can actually solve in six weeks.",,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"We won’t do an experiment as such, but we will do we want. We also don't have enough time for like a big overview. But what we want to do is just like focus on one thing that we're curious about and then read papers on that topic. It would be kind of like an overview, but not. But we would have like our own goal with it, not just summarize, but like, OK, we're interested in this specific particular thing.",,,SC1 11.10,
EN,"OK, so so our paper is gonna be like, like an analysis of a certain question based on research literature out there.",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,Yeah,,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"Yeah. I think that's what we're supposed to do in this course. We can't really make a experiment and collect data, obviously not so.",,,SC1 11.10,
EN,"So we just have to for relevant literature, right.",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,"So yeah, got cut out. I'm sorry, my friend. Can you repeat that?",,,SC1 11.10,
EN,"I said, I guess we just have to look for the relevant literatures.",,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"Yeah, figure out which kind of specific topic we want and then look up the literature. Yeah, exactly. Is everyone cool with that? Do we agree on that or are there still questions?",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,"Yeah, it makes sense for me.",,,SC1 11.10,
LC,Yep,,,SC1 11.10,
AI,Yep. Cool. Next to choosing a better topic and then looking up papers.,,,SC1 11.10,
AS,"Yeah, so do you want to share that I can share my screen again and go on that page and we can think of more topics? Or do we want to stick with the the this, the internal versus external scripts going into fading and new CSCL scripts?",,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"Honestly, I think I just want to look up what kind of CSCL script papers there are and then figure out what's the current status.",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,OK,,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"just like an overview for myself and then I'd figure out a question, but I don't know.",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,"No, it's not a bad idea because we could, we could just each like, you know, assign ourselves homework, everybody look at two to three things that interest you and then maybe there will be some overlap between us and then we can kinda focus from there. I don't know. What do you guys think? How should we go about this?",,,SC1 11.10,
LC,"I think, I think based on the keywords we have, let's look for like 3-4 articles each and let's like, let's see if it it works for a topic or if it doesn't and let's bring up the conclusions next time we meet, which should be I guess soon.",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,Yeah,,,SC1 11.10,
LC,"So we can actually articulate that, the same question",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,"Yeah, So what are the keywords then? that we're deciding ",,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"CSCL scripting, that's for sure, ",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,Yes,,,SC1 11.10,
AI,Do you also want to add fading or does someone want to add something else?,,,SC1 11.10,
AS,"I like the idea of internal external, so I'll kind of go back stick with that.",,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"Yeah, okay, internal, external. Should we all then focus on internal external or should we like also do something else? I think focusing on that would be better. There's somewhat research papers, yeah.",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,Or HA or yeah. You guys have any ideas that you like to to kind of propose or run with?,,,SC1 11.10,
HA,"Yeah I think like what what I would do is like off like go following the same keywords at you but like maybe like with different articles maybe or maybe there could be some overlapping but like do my own research on that and then we come up out with each other. But like, I don't want to suggest new keywords because it could be too many.",,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"A quick idea as well, before we all accidentally read the same paper, should we post them in a chat so we see which papers the others have read?",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,Yeah,,,SC1 11.10,
LC,"yeah, we should make a little Excel document, like pointing out,",,,SC1 11.10,
HA,Yeah,,,SC1 11.10,
LC,"the name of the article and the the location, the URL. So we definitely don't have mistakes or like overlap.",,,SC1 11.10,
AI,I like that idea.,,,SC1 11.10,
HA,"Yeah, we can make a scratch it. Excel,",,,SC1 11.10,
AI,New Excel study papers. I made one.,,,SC1 11.10,
AS,So fast.,,,SC1 11.10,
HA,Yeah,,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"Yeah, I tried to be fast. Do we then just like, yeah, title, then next thing URL and that's it.",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,"I already got one, so ",,,SC1 11.10,
AI,You already got one. Put it in quickly. Someone else might steal.,,,SC1 11.10,
HA,"So it will be like the title of the article, the name of the person that is reading it.",,,SC1 11.10,
AI,Okay.,,,SC1 11.10,
HA,And can we like write the like our analysis on the next column there also or we need to put it somewhere else?,,,SC1 11.10,
AS,We could just do that me as well. Or what do you think xxx,,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"put all the notes in an Excel sheet I think that'll be a bit much, wouldn't it? and depending on ",,,SC1 11.10,
HA,that's the thing that I'm thinking.,,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"I mean we could use the other, the share, the other shared file we have and then you just use the same title and then put it, you know the paper that we just had open.",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,Mhm,,,SC1 11.10,
AI,I see in your eyes,,,SC1 11.10,
LC,"I think since you're used to put everything on the same Excel sheet, so like all the information is just in one place and that's actually a really easy way to analyze it later. Like which goes and which doesn't.",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,"No, I agree we should just keep the name of the article and who's reading it on the Excel sheet and put our notes somewhere. Is that what you mean LC?",,,SC1 11.10,
LC,"Or no, put it put everything together like that's easier. That's way easier because it's super visual and you can start.",,,SC1 11.10,
HA,Yeah,,,SC1 11.10,
LC,You won't get missed in the among the information. It's all there in just one single place and then we can all next time look at it together and like start deleting or highlighting or whatever in all in same place.,,,SC1 11.10,
AS,I I'm okay either way.,,,SC1 11.10,
HA,"So you mean that like on that Excel sheet we will like put our analysis and like kind of overview in a short way that like all of the information went in the same file and like after reading it, we put out like main takeaways on that file in a column. Is that is, is that possible?",,,SC1 11.10,
LC,"Yes. That's, that's it. Thank you for organizing.",,,SC1 11.10,
HA,"Yeah and then we can of course, like we can like take longer notes somewhere else or like even we",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,Yeah.,,,SC1 11.10,
HA,…can create a the file in the folder that like in the Excel file we try to put some short main take aways.,,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"OK, Yeah. All right. Cool. Do we have our idea then? Is that it? I see AS is doing the Excel things. Great.",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,Yeah. Sorry. This is my personality.,,,SC1 11.10,

LC,Bye guys.,,,SC1 11.10,
AS,Bye,,,SC1 11.10,

HA,OK ,,,SC1 11.10,
AI,And I thought if you don't want to add that and cool.,,,SC1 11.10,
AS,"Source, author, and person, right?",,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"And then one last one would like overview, which is like a bigger block.",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,"Yeah, that. That's the one I'm struggling with. I knew I need to add that. But how do I add that? You know what I mean? Like, because it's gonna be a bigger box.",,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"OK, I see what you. I mean, the other boxes could then just like, you know, get larger. I think we don't have to worry about the aesthetic that much. This is that's not our job.",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,"Yeah, that's true Overview, right.",,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"What was? Well, what? What else were we actually supposed to do? Um, define the aim of our, to find an aim, to define questions, to define context. Context is interesting.",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,"Yeah, I think that those are all gonna have to be answered after we read these. Look at these articles.",,,SC1 11.10,
HA,Yeah. So when is the next meeting to gather on the thing that we get?,,,SC1 11.10,
AS,"Sooner than later, I think.",,,SC1 11.10,
HA,"Yeah. Yeah, of course. Of course. So like, I just want to note it down on my schedule so that I can like, like plan to read it.",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,"EN, sorry, Are you trying to say something? We hear noises, but we're not sure if.",,,SC1 11.10,
EN,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was gonna ask if our next meeting would be next week by this time or we have to meet before then.",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,"I think we're deciding that now, basically. Uh, I mean in the evenings, like, I don't finish class. Like my latest class is always like 4:00 PM and I don't work right now so I can't work, so that works. Anybody else? Like what works for you guys?",,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"How don’t we just stick to Wednesdays, like 16 German time, 17 finish time. And then if something urgent comes up, maybe we can do something on the weekend as well. Or Friday evening because those are usually free.",,,SC1 11.10,
HA,"Yeah, for me…",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,So you guys wAI wait another week? That to me seems like a long time to wait because we don't have that much time.,,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"Ohh okay. Do you think then maybe instead we should read the articles on our own? And then maybe maybe by Sunday try to like in the shared file write down what we find like for the aim and for the question, do you want to have a meeting again?",,,SC1 11.10,
AS, I don't know what is the group think HA and EN.,,,SC1 11.10,
EN,"Yeah, I think we can do that asynchronously. Yeah, do not necessarily meet, but between I say Sunday. So our next meeting, we should all pin our ideas down on the spreadsheet.",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,OK,,,SC1 11.10,
HA,"So like you mean that the, the idea on the spreadsheet should be ready by Sunday?",,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"No, no, not by Sunday. By next Wednesday. It's just a question.",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,"No, I I agree with EN. I think Sunday then we can at least read each other's. And then on Wednesday when we meet in person, then at least we have an idea of what we're talking about. So… AI that doesn't work for you or?",,,SC1 11.10,
HA,"So like can it be like, you know, like by Monday it mean like I have the whole Sunday to do that to like ",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,"Do you want to do it for Monday? Yeah, I'm OK with Sunday.",,,SC1 11.10,
HA,"Because if it’s by Sunday, I need to complete it some like on Saturday because actually you know like this time it a little bit burn out for me that like a lot deadline this week",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,Okay,,,SC1 11.10,
HA,"So like by by Monday it means like I have some time on the Sunday to do it and then you can it will be ready on Monday, so you can look at it from Monday. Is that OK?",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,Yeah,,,SC1 11.10,
AI,If I just look at my calendar and remove the weekly plans.,,,SC1 11.10,
AS,I gotta leave. But whatever you guys decide I'm cool with. The only question I have is how many articles should we get each two?,,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"Oh two I'm fine with. Yeah, please.",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,OK.,,,SC1 11.10,
HA,Yeah,,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"If you have time for more, go ahead. Sure. I don't.",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,"OK, You guys decide the dates and then just let me know. I'll just read it. If you get somebody can just post our homework and our meeting date dates, then, uh, we can go from there. Is it OK if I go?",,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"Yeah, go. Go ahead.",,,SC1 11.10,
HA,"Sure. So we will meet again like, um, next Wednesday This time.",,,SC1 11.10,
AS,Bye.,,,SC1 11.10,
HA,See you.,,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"Um. Can we freeze still, like just for Aneesh? So we know that we can tell him the time that he wanted. We agree on working on it with like until Monday, working on it until Monday. By Monday the spreadsheet is filled, we can all read it, and then for Wednesday we can together decide which is the final aim and everything.",,,SC1 11.10,
HA,Yeah,,,SC1 11.10,
EN,Yeah,,,SC1 11.10,
HA,So I hope that like on Wednesday we can have the aim.,,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"The final question, what want to do here.",,,SC1 11.10,
HA,Yeah,,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"God, Jesus. OK. I hope you have a great weekend. I won't.",,,SC1 11.10,
HA,It seems like I will have no weekend.,,,SC1 11.10,
AI,Same. At least we're all in this together. So that's nice.,,,SC1 11.10,
HA,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"Okay, do you want to stop the recording or do can we end the, do we end the call for that?",,,SC1 11.10,
HA,"Yeah. Like if we leave the call, so it will automatically end And I Yeah.",,,SC1 11.10,
AI,"Okay then. So bye, bye you.",,,SC1 11.10,
HA,Thank you a lot.,,,SC1 11.10,
EN,Bye,,,SC1 11.10,
AI,Thank you too.,,,SC1 11.10,
AS,"All right. So nice time to be professional. Oh, we already started recording. I mean, we're ready for professional. ",,,SC1 11.17,That’s odd. Not sure if the connection went off or something.
AI,As we can be. Right.,,,SC1 11.17,"Again, leaving, she's leaving? Hmm, strange."
AS,"I guess what like we were talking in the in the text messages, like I don't know about you guys. Like I did read through everybody else's articles, not the whole thing obviously because that's a lot of reading, but just kind of the general ideas. HA, I didn't get to yours unfortunately, but it looks like we have a lot of empirical information, right? It just like more about…",,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, I think she's typing something."
AI,Data collection. Is that it?,,,SC1 11.17,Uh-huh.
AS,What's that?,,,SC1 11.17,"Maybe her teams has a problem again. Oh, loading."
AI,Do you mean data collection?,,,SC1 11.17,OK. We will wait. I always do it.
AS,"Yeah, that thing.",,,SC1 11.17,"We were supposed to have our first draft reading next Tuesday, right? (inaudible) I think. OK Katharina's here. OK, so we’re all here."
AI,"OK Yeah. Yeah, I agree with that.",,,SC1 11.17,Yep.
AS,What? Sorry. You're cutting out.,,P,SC1 11.17,Katharina? Can you hear us? Oh great.
AI,"Yeah, I agree with that.",,P,SC1 11.17,Yeah
AS,"Yeah. So I guess if the question comes up then is like, how do we wAI take this, like? And I guess my question, as per usual, is what exactly are we doing? Like, what is this?",,P,SC1 11.17,"OK, great"
AI,"Yes, What? Maybe we should ask our tutor about it. Like what and in which direction the paper should go. Should it be more of an overview? Should it be like a theory kind of that we think of, or is that really just we can do whatever?",,P,SC1 11.17,Sorry for my…
AS,Yeah. Are we able to access Professor Weinberger right now? Or.,,P,SC1 11.17,It's OK. Uh.
AI,"I think for us it would be Maria, actually. So.",,,SC1 11.17,And- and sorry for my switch off camera because I don't know what's the problem right now from the technical side.
AS,"Oh, it's Maria. It's not professor.",,P,SC1 11.17,No worries.
AI,Yeah. She's the tutor. He's the professor. It's not a level.,,,SC1 11.17,"OK, so do we want to discuss about the, the paper parts list? 
Share the paper. Hmm, there's the paper. This one, OK. So ah. I think we tried to look at the rubrics, uh, there were quite a few that didn't have the information right? Let me open. uh, the rubrics. This one, right? So are we going to narrow down to choose a few criteria that we want to look at or something? Like I think there were a few that most did not have much information. For example. OK, I think this, uh, what is this, EMODA had a lot of information. I didn't manage to find a lot of information for SEST."
LC,Yeah.,,,SC1 11.17,"But that's fine. I mean, if there are no- no more information
then you can't just invent anything. So I think..."
AS,"Oh, OK. I'm missing this team was our…Sorry, LC what?",,,SC1 11.17,Yeah.
LC,What We should send her a message like on teams I think like with all the questions we have right now like finish the meeting with a bunch of questions that we are going to send to Maria.,,,SC1 11.17,it's fine.
AI,Exactly,,,SC1 11.17,So I think-
AS,"I can try messaging her now just to just because I think we are approaching time. So if we end this meeting with questions and not any results, we have lost more time. That's just my my feeling. I don't know about anybody else I agree with.",,,SC1 11.17,"I, I think in digital- in technical part, not some more information for these free tools."
AI,Yeah I would also like to text her.,,,SC1 11.17,Yes. So maybe the technical part is not so important for us as well to analyze.
HA,"Yeah. So again like what? What is her name? Like, what is a tutor?",,,SC1 11.17,And the mobile design as I see.
AS,"Maria. My oh, I can't. I can't switch without ending the call.",,,SC1 11.17,"Hmm? Uh, so technical. We do not need to look at this. Ah. 
Accessibility. I'm not sure where you able to find that. I can't find- Yeah, not much."
AI,"Right, That's true. Do you have teams on your phone? Oh, smart cookie, aren't you?",,,SC1 11.17,"Not much, no."
AI,That's what (inaudible; joking),,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah. Yeah, for functionality, maybe we can talk a bit, it depends on…"
HA,"We can open it at the same time on my laptop because I when I have meeting here, but I can still open the team channel in the other tab.",,,SC1 11.17,"But functionality is a main category, first category."
AI,Oh really?,,,SC1 11.17,This one?
HA,"Yeah, so, but, like, do we have any, like, meeting with our tutor in the future, like coaching or Q and AI?",,,SC1 11.17,Ah yes.
AS,I don't know.,,,SC1 11.17,It-
AI,We can just ask them. That's it.,,,SC1 11.17,But- it's repeated under like a sub category on the mobile design.
AS,I just gonna call it now.,,,SC1 11.17,"Oh, Oh yeah, OK."
LC,Oh Fridays. There's always this.,,,SC1 11.17,Alright.
AS,"Oh, yeah. With the girl.",,,SC1 11.17,"And I think, uh, mobile design also is not important for us."
HA,What? What on Friday?,,,SC1 11.17,Yeah.
LC,Yeah. I can go there like this Friday. Like they can assist in case we need to ask anything else.,,,SC1 11.17,No.
AS,"Yeah, I think I What time is it? At 5:00 PM? Right, Our time?",,,SC1 11.17,"This also, like no information at all."
AI,5:00 PM Who…(murmuring),,,SC1 11.17,"Yes, yes data protection."
LC,"Yeah, I think it's at 5:00 PM.",,,SC1 11.17,Social presence.
AS,"Let's say we are wondering about the direction of it. Like, should we create an argumentative paper or a what? What were the other choices?",,,SC1 11.17,"I think this can be helpful and especially the collaboration
part maybe."
HA,Literature review?,,,SC1 11.17,Uh-huh.
AS,Yeah. Literature review or something else?,,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, maybe. Maybe we don't have to split them into these three parts because the other two- most of us do not have enough information, so we can just look at it as a whole. Social presence."
HA,Yeah.,,,SC1 11.17,Uh-huh.
AI,"Maybe you could ask a more open-ended question, like what types of papers could we write? Actually, ",,,SC1 11.17,"Teaching presence, I'm not so sure about this part."
AS,"Yeah, basically what type?",,,SC1 11.17,"Maybe we can just rename this part. I mean, we don't teach with this tool, but we use it in a kind of way to facilitate emotional regulation, for example. Maybe we could just-"
LC,Or maybe If they can give us examples of.,,,SC1 11.17,So like how easy it is to facilitate or something like-
AI,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,rename.
HA,"No, do you remember on the meeting that question Essi answered is my question.",,,SC1 11.17,"that, how teachers can-"
AI,True.,,,SC1 11.17,How teachers can use it.
HA,"Like, I want to see the example of last year, but Essi say no.",,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, usage. Yeah or."
AS,"Oh OK Oh, she's replying right now.",,,SC1 11.17,Teacher's usage?
AI,We don't have to ask for the exact examples when we can just maybe ask what type of paper it was. I think that'll.,,,SC1 11.17,"Yes, teachers' usage."
AS,"Yeah, it's actually up to you.",,,SC1 11.17,"OK, so we can look at this. For my SEST is more like individual. They didn't really talk about like teachers at all.
It's just your own reflection."
AI,"Thank you, Maria. That is certainly helpful.",,,SC1 11.17,"In my tool Emoda, is more about… It's not collaborative tool, it tested like teachers as- learners interaction, and mostly for teacher's usage."
AS,"Oh, OK, awesome smiley face . ",,,SC1 11.17,"Ah, OK, so our- our tools have different aspects, so mine is-"
AI,"You can ask her about, like, recommendations maybe. I don't know. Yeah, just too much freedom.",,,SC1 11.17,Yes. 
HA,"Oh, so they should have a script for this.",,,SC1 11.17,"(inaudible). OK, that's something we can (inaudible) I guess."
AS,We'll get in the CSCL OULU environment. This what the structure should look like. Where do we see the structure?,,,SC1 11.17,Uh-huh.
LC,"Guys, I'm, I'm thinking we could like we have a bunch of articles already. We could like literally make an analysis of that data we have there. Like if it's empirical, if they're literally experiments, if something works or it doesn't work, analyze that, get some conclusions and discuss the results. And that would be like a nice article, I guess.",,,SC1 11.17,"And cognitive, I'm not so sure. Seems like you all had something under cognitive."
AS,So why I can't really hear you? Is it my computer?,,,SC1 11.17,It's like just awareness about emotion.
AI,"No. It's hard. It is hard. But you mean that we take the information that we get from the papers, analyze it, and then draw, draw, draw our own conclusions from that? Something like that, right?",,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, that's the same with the S-REG."
LC,Yeah. Can you hear me better now?,,,SC1 11.17,OK. 
AS,"Yeah, now it's better. Yeah.",,,SC1 11.17,"And how- Uh, we concentrate on more positive rather than negative emotion and in educational context."
LC,"Oh, amazing. OK, so these headphones are useless. What I was saying is we should, like, we have already have a few articles, like gathered together. So we should analyze like the empirical articles, like the things they got right and the things that they go wrong and draw some conclusions about it, like write conclusions and analyse that data we have there. And that could actually be a real article like the final thing that we do.",,,SC1 11.17,How they changed the thinking?
HA,"So two questions. First like do you have any like example of that kind of article so that like we can base on that like we can like run the same structure. And the second question is that for that kind of article, do we need to examine more article? Is that 9 enough for us to analyze or we need more?",,,SC1 11.17,Yes.
AS,"So I'm just gonna interrupt because she replied one more time. She said last year we did a literature review where in a certain way we summed up different ideas and made one unique overview, which is basically what LC just said, right?",,,SC1 11.17,"Like appraisal? OK, so we can keep this part."
LC,"Yeah, exactly.",,,SC1 11.17,Yeah.
AS,How did you know LC? Are you really Maria in disguise? ,,,SC1 11.17,"OK. So that we can look at the emotional parts. Anthony, are you able to find articles on FROCOLE or it will just be-"
LC,Ah yeah,,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, I was just gonna say, uhm I will get this- like this part
filled in by tonight."
HA,Can you xxx like put it in the WhatsApp?,,,SC1 11.17,OK.
AS,What's that?,,,SC1 11.17,"If you have problems finding the articles, we can ask Essi."
HA,Can you copy her suggestion?,,,SC1 11.17,Yeah.
AS,"Yeah, she's still typing, so I'm just gonna wait for her to finish. She has a lot to say apparently. ",,,SC1 11.17,"OK, OK."
AI,Appreciate that.,,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, because I think I tried to find before but I couldn't
really find. Not sure if I found- I see I didn't. I didn't take a long time to find but I didn't see anything."
AS,"Yeah, and I appreciate that too. What was I gonna say? Yeah, I think LC's is good. One of the articles that I read was about gamification.",,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, I'll ask my friend, uh, Maria. She's actually one of the
main tutors."
LC,Mm hmm.,,,SC1 11.17,"Supervisor, uh-huh."
AS,"And it didn't talk directly about scripting, but the ideas were so related. It just about and I think based on what LC said and what Maria's saying now, we could have that as a unique overview.",,,SC1 11.17,"Uhm, and I'll, I'll ask her if she has anything."
LC,"Yeah. Although I think we should narrow a little bit the the search like trying to be super specific with keywords because like if we were to publish that in a real journal, they would ask us like a clear methodology. And one of the first steps for having a clear methodology is being super straight enough, which specific words and terms and theories behind those words are we using to analyze. So…",,,SC1 11.17,"OK, that'll be great."
AS,"Yeah, we should definitely focus, isn't that what we're focusing on?",,,SC1 11.17,I'm sorry I (inaudible).
LC,"Yeah, I think so. I mean the this, the articles I found, I found them looking for CSCL plus. Oh my gosh. I forgot, let me look for ",,P,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, it's okay. We have until next week so we just have to get our parts done by Monday maybe."
AI,xxx and internal scripts. That's what you told me.,,,SC1 11.17,Yeah.
LC,Yeah. OK that that's it.,,,SC1 11.17,"And I have one suggestion for Kofi. Because in the last session we decided not to assign for you a specific tool. Uh, but now we explain some- some aspects of choosing selected tools and maybe after our conversation you can
find any interesting insights. And recommend us something."
LC,"But literally like that and that's that's how I found it. So we should, I mean I guess we should like focus like be super specifics on the terms so we can get like overview but on any specific topic and we can analyze it.",,,SC1 11.17,"Oh, come again, the last part."
HA,Yeah. I agree.,,,SC1 11.17,"Uh, during this session, like now we present our tools like some summary that we analyzed and read. And maybe during this session you came up with so- come up with some ideas how we can improve it. For example."
AI,"Well, I just want to ask like just so I understand the example, kind of the articles I read did like analyze themselves like how scripts, if they have any effect on learning and the like, how good the students were at the end, let's just call it that, Like their performance and their collaborative, you know, ",,,SC1 11.17,"For the paper, right?"
AS,Results?,,,SC1 11.17,"Yes yes yes, because as I see now, we four except Kofi like
concentrated more on tools."
LC,"Yeah, results. ",,,SC1 11.17,Mhm.
AI,"Yeah, kind of. And then they came to conclusions. So in, in the example you gave of what we should do what, what do you want to do with that information?",,,SC1 11.17,And maybe Kofi can have some external observer.
LC,"OK. So first I got it all in my head. It's OK. So first the introduction should be like literally talking about the topic we're going to talk about and like introduce the theory like a general theory. Then in the in the method we should say like exactly how did we search for what we search? You know, like we looked for this and these keywords and we use this and this search engines such as Google Scholar in the results part we should literally make a table super similar of the table we have in on the Excel sheet, like stating who was the author, where was it down, which year, whatever. And then in the discussion, which is the super important part, we should like start talking about like this author did this and it was good because of this and that. But then this other author realized and this and that was better, I don't know whatever.",,,SC1 11.17,Mhm.
HA,Mhm,,,SC1 11.17,And can recommend us- 
AI,"Yeah, so in that way you would for example. Then with the articles I I read, you would then be like, OK And this author came to the conclusion that scripts have this effect on collaboration or. Yeah, yeah, something like that.",,,SC1 11.17,"Oh, OK."
LC,Yeah. Or we could like look for similarities. Like we realized this methodology is constant among All authors or something like that.,,,SC1 11.17,Can recommend us more deeply.
AS,Mm hmm.,,,SC1 11.17,Like you can integrate all of them together. What’s the- what I-
AI,"Oh yeah, I like that.",,,SC1 11.17,"Yes, yes."
HA,"Yeah. Even when I I don't have any, like, you know, like and I mentioned before I don't have background, never write kind of article. But when when you like when LC said that I I feel I can imagine it. And that's just like the the most important part is the discussion there we will like we will analyze that this also said this and then give our comment and then try to connect that that article that article to the main topic and then like we try to organize and make them in a logical way. But like my question is that we need a research question for ourselves. Like even not like we are not creating something new, but some research question. And then we look at the literature, look at the article and then like when when we analyze like each article, we will come back, like is how this article answer our research question. ",,,SC1 11.17,"did put things across the tools and what can do better like so for my, like for example my tool is more individual, like on the individual level where they will monitor their own emotions. They- they write down what they feel and then they think about what can they do next. And come up with some proactive steps."
AS,"Yeah, that's what I was thinking. That's why I wanted to bring in the gamification part because like and I think that like for me that what from what I read and looking at what you guys read like there is still that gap of how do you transition from external to internal scripting.",,,SC1 11.17,Hmm.
LC,OK,,,SC1 11.17,OK.
AS,Is that would be… what's that?,,,SC1 11.17,"Then I think, um, Galina’s tool is- she was saying is, uh, 
engagement, right? Between teacher and students?"
AI,"kind of what goes, yeah",,,SC1 11.17,"Yes, yes, I can explain. For example, could you share please
our Word document?"
AS,"Ok, oh now she replied again. Hold on, she said. Oh, **** She gave a whole ******* speech. '",,,SC1 11.17,"Word document, hold on, let me just open."
LC,Oh that's good.,,,SC1 11.17,"I uh, I just made some summary about EMODA tool."
AS,"OK, let me just copy this into the chat, because it's the long one. One second, OK?",,,SC1 11.17,Here.
HA,"Yeah, we should ",,,SC1 11.17,"Yes. Is- I see first of all it's some. Uh, some superstructure, and it doesn't exist separately, um. In my- in the research that I have read, uh, EMODA, it's like a dashboard."
AI,she was waiting for someone to ask her. ,,,SC1 11.17,Mhm.
AS,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,"But a real conversation was in the Speak Plus platform. It's some learning foreign language platform. There, uh, there is an individual lesson for- for student. It's synchronous online lesson between teachers, teacher and learner. And the- during this 45, if remember correctly, session, researchers, uhm, record. First of all, use some Microsoft tools for face
reading. Also other tool for voice recording and recognition. Uh, and they use also self reporting before and after session and breaking emotion peaks with some, uhm, learning activities like sharing documents or sharing audio files or present (inaudible) documents, something like that and it uses mostly in the- in the- in this research, mostly for teachers. But not in real time feedbacking but, uh, post processing. Like after session, teachers can analyze this data, uh, in the- in this dashboard and, uh, implement these ideas for the next lessons. For example like that."
AI,Finally. Give it all. ,,,SC1 11.17,OK.
LC,"She's like, super talkative. Like I'm in a podcast with her, like doing the podcasting, and she always explains everything in a super detailed way. And she gets so excited. It's so nice.",,,SC1 11.17,"And this is like a- this picture, like a dashboard for teachers."
AI,"Yeah, that's nice.",,,SC1 11.17,Hmm.
AS,So I'm just gonna do it into the WhatsApp group because I I still can't leave. Is that OK?,,,SC1 11.17,"However, if (inaudible) others suggested that it can be used
also for learners. But I can't read- I can’t find more appropriate, yes, information."
AI,"Yep. Oh, God.",,,SC1 11.17,Information.
AS,Yeah I told you it was long.,,,SC1 11.17,OK.
AI,36 articles.,,,SC1 11.17,And here I presented just quickly advantages and disadvantages.
AS,See 2000 to 2020.,,,SC1 11.17,"OK, cool. I think you can add onto my- my one because my one is a self report. But yours is a, there's a biologic sensor."
LC,"Yep, that sounds like a good. Yeah, amount of articles. Because when you like, when you do the search, like let's say we pick up three search engines like Google Scholar, I don't know which ",,,SC1 11.17,"Yes, yes it's- it's more multi- multi model approach using biological sensors and subjective emotion from students."
AS,J store.,,,SC1 11.17,"Oh, this is a self-report, right? So this is a-"
LC,"Yeah, that kind of thing. And we look for the specific keywords then we're going to get out like 102 hundred articles. And then what we have to do then it's like select some exclusion criteria like the articles should be written in for schools or or universities like you know like ",,,SC1 11.17,Yes yes yes.
AI,using specific level of yeah ,,,SC1 11.17,"Because, like more specific level, I guess. And Katharina's one is, uh."
LC,"yeah and start narrowing the the like our focus and we can actually end up with Parry or 25 Parry articles. That would be a good number, I guess. Or that's what I would like being asked when I was while I was at my university. So something similar.",,,SC1 11.17,"There's (inaudible) the advantages of the emotional regulation or emotions in general, and if the emotion regulation is bad in the group, they have to find like some regulation strategy so that they talk about it, how they can improve it. So it's more only collaboration level."
AI,"It makes sense, yeah, it's just a lot more than I expected, but I guess makes sense.",,,SC1 11.17,Ah.
AS,"Yeah, well, she said. She said like they really looked at about 5 to 10 of them and the rest of them they just skimmed so they didn't actually do all of the all of the work like all of the reading.",,,SC1 11.17,And the group level.
HA,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,OK.
AI,Is that what she said?,,,SC1 11.17,Interesting.
HA,"Yeah, at the end ",,,SC1 11.17,So we have three different perspectives.
AS,36 reviewed articles means 5 to 10 really read other scheme to see what emerges as a potential topic and so on.,,,SC1 11.17,Yes.
AI,"Oh, I thought you meant that then per person you read only 5 to 10.",,,SC1 11.17,"But that's when we- when, uh, this, we can put into the discussion part."
AS,"No, No, no, no, no, no. OK, I think you read two each.",,,SC1 11.17,Yeah. I guess so.
HA,"We can look at the, umm abstract introduction and then resolve a discussion and we can like somehow uh, scheme is scanned through the the middle of the articles.",,,SC1 11.17,So.
AI,"OK, I think that's good.",,,SC1 11.17,"So I think we don't have this part, analysis and results, right?"
AS,"I'm just I'm just asking her what she means by uh. Additionally, we included implications on instructional and teaching practices. Like is that her own idea or is that hmm something they found 'cause it goes back to HA's question too, like should we include something?",,,SC1 11.17,Mhm.
HA,"Yeah, in the article, in some articles that I read they some article they have the implication part, just a short partial paragraph like how do they think that this theory and these findings could be implemented in the practice. So just some some of our suggestion, I think we we could do it if we want.",,,SC1 11.17,"We can in the analysis part, we can put the, the characterizations that we had."
LC,"So yeah, it could actually be a section of the the discussion like possible applications in the future or something like that. And then we can because there are a few articles that I saw that say something similar. So we can just get that together and point out all the possible directions.",,,SC1 11.17,Rubric?
AS,"Sorry, I was gonna interrupt again because she gives messaging with these fields. Is that OK, you guys? So I asked her what do you mean by implications on instructional and teaching practices and she said the idea is to extract she spelled extract wrong the ideas from other research and then to try to come up with some new directions with future research new ideas. She said it ties you can write and cite reference paper thing. The personal overview is really important.",,,SC1 11.17,Or the evaluation points that we focused on our tools.
HA,Yeah kind of personal overview.,,,SC1 11.17,"OK, the few aspects of it."
AS,"Yeah, she says really important. That's where words really you can't see it. I'll, I'll copy paste this.",,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, why we- Why we had a look on them, maybe."
HA,"So I think like we just now we just need to like focus on the the the main thing that we want to do. And after that if we have some time and we want to include that implication, we we can like do it. Yeah later but if we feel that we don't have enough time or it's not like mandatory so.",,,SC1 11.17,"Should we also add here at analysis and results our uh, 
rubrics, description?"
AS,but she is saying really important. So I think it's really important.,,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, yeah, that's what we- what I meant."
HA,"I think like she want to like emphasize some kind of some of our own contribution because we if we just go through the literature, the xxx thing.",,,SC1 11.17,"So, so the structure of our paper will be at this- at this part it will actually be just the description of our tool, right?"
AS,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree with you. Maybe you start from the beginning to see what emerges from the from the other literature that we have, and then extrapolate from there. Right?",,,SC1 11.17,Yes.
HA,"AI, you're going to say something?",,,SC1 11.17,"Before the pros and cons will be under the, the part of analysis, is that right?"
AI,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. My brain is processing.",,,SC1 11.17,Yes.
LC,I have. I have a tiny question.,,,SC1 11.17,"That's right, yeah, yeah."
AS,Mhm,,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, because there are two ways we can organize it. We can, you know, organize like the tool then pros and cons. Tool #2 and pros and cons."
LC,Did we all look for information only in Google Scholar?,,,SC1 11.17,Uh-huh.
AS,"I got one, the one from J store. And I think ",,,SC1 11.17,"Or we can just have a discussion of tool #1, tool #2, tool #3 and then analysis of tool #1, analysis of tool #2, analysis of the- the tool. It's just that I'm not sure like which format do we want."
AI,"what I want to mention, LC, is that Google Scholar isn't actually like that one page that collects articles. It's more just like it's Google. It's still Google. So it's not like an actual source because when you click on the links, yeah, then it gets you to another page.",,,SC1 11.17,"I can suggest for example, uh, now as I see, we represents short description about tools, except with- this is my highlighted yellow and later in analysis and results we can for example, used our rubrics and go for proof this. For
example, first category is functionality. And blah blah blah blah blah. Next category should be social presence."
LC,"So yeah, but I I've actually seen that before in review articles like, ",,,SC1 11.17,Do you have any (inaudible)?
AI,So they did use?,,,SC1 11.17,"Yes, teachers use- usage. Cognitive presence and emotion
regulation criteria."
LC,"Yeah, in high quality journal, really, really high quality. But we should also look for other ones, of course. Possibly it will be easier to find more if we look in different places.",,,SC1 11.17,So that means that we would explain these rubrics.
AI,Do you know of different places to look for? Because I I thought Google Scholar was like the baseline that you ,,,SC1 11.17,Yes.
AS,"Let me ask her, Let me ask Maria. I'm sure she's gonna give you a list of 40 of them.",,,SC1 11.17,"And then we will draw a line to our tools or just the rubrics, and then we discuss it in the end."
LC,"So actually we should have access to several databases in our library. I'm not sure how to access yet, but we should have access of like three articles in the databases provided by the libraries of our university.",,,SC1 11.17,"(everyone thinking, silence 20 seconds)"
AS,"Yeah, but with those ones you have to be on campus to use them. I've tried to access ",,,SC1 11.17,Mmm.
AI,VPN as well?,,P,SC1 11.17,Some break
AS,"Yeah, well Elsevier, ",,P,SC1 11.17,(smiling)
LC,"We cannot access them like because we're not at the university. I do know a web page which is super super. I don't want to say illegal, but ",,,SC1 11.17,"Oh no, Katarina is leaving."
AS,Questionable? ,,,SC1 11.17,Connection is.
AI,Questionable.,,,SC1 11.17,"But umm, I’m a bit confused. If we’re already explaining in the previous section like."
LC,"Questionable. And it lets you open almost every article you can find online free for free. So if you want it, I can send it to Whatsapp.",,,SC1 11.17,We just explain how it works.
AI,"Maybe that would be a good idea, actually, but also will probably produce a lot of papers that might be not that great if it's just too many. But I don't know.",,,SC1 11.17,OK.
AS,"Yeah, she's given us some. Yeah, I'll, I'll write them down as well. Elsevier.",,,SC1 11.17,"Without any aspects, rubric aspects. In general."
AI,Did you know there's a Microsoft academic apparently? As an alternative to Google Scholar.,,,SC1 11.17,Mhm. Or just the- the previous section is just in general and then this is like specifically to these.
AS,"Eric is the one that I use, but it's so hard to access all of them on there. ResearchGate. ResearchGate is a good one as well,",,,SC1 11.17,"Yes, to this rubric."
AI,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, and then yeah. And then in the discussions and limitations, that would just be an overview of like all of them, then what can improve."
LC,I think ,,,SC1 11.17,Maybe here in analysis and results we just put explanation-
AS,"Oh, that's Journals of CSCL.",,,SC1 11.17,Mhm.
LC,"Yeah, that's a good one. I think if we use four different databases and we'll look for like specific keywords in same keywords in those four databases, we'll get like it is in the amount of articles.",,,SC1 11.17,"in each, this rubric- rubrics just, ah. Make sure to explanation for example in functionality. For example, I can write EMODA is blah blah blah blah blah, next. Uh, Katharina or Hui Ni can."
AI,"I think, yeah, you're right",,,SC1 11.17,Wouldn’t this be like redundant?
AS,"I will say to her, wow, you are a fountain of knowledge. That's a good thing to say, right?",,,SC1 11.17,Can you repeat please?
AI,Yeah. That's a good crown comment.,,,SC1 11.17,"Wouldn't this be redundant, like how? Unless I'm missing something, like, I don't know. Is this part necessary? That's what I'm saying."
HA,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, I I get your point because otherwise it would, like, or we would repeat a lot of things."
AI,She deserves it as well though.,,,SC1 11.17,Yeah.
AS,"Yeah, definitely.",,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, so another- the- the other way of organizing might be
better where we straight away talk about the analysis right
after the tool, right?"
LC,"Yeah, she's super nice explaining things.",,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, or what do you think if we just switch the parts that we- first, um, write the-"
AI,"But back to the question that we're here for, right? The choosing of topic or the aim or the research question. Any ideas what exactly we want to do?",,,SC1 11.17,Introduce this.
HA,That's important.,,,SC1 11.17,"The rubrics, yeah, we explain them and afterwards we- "
AI,And that's the hardest part.,,,SC1 11.17,We talk about the tools.
AS,"Yeah, but can we not come up with it after we do the comparisons? Or should it be done beforehand? Like, can we work backwards here?",,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, right?"
AI,"Well, the comparisons for those who already kind of need the keywords, you know, Because otherwise we could just be like, oh, I want this one and I want this one. I would just be too much work, I think.",,,SC1 11.17,Yeah.
AS,"Well, that's like my idea and I don't know if you guys like it. Like how do we go from, how do we get students using CSCL to go from external scripts to internal scripts?",,,SC1 11.17,Uh-huh.
HA,Cool.,,,SC1 11.17,It would make more sense.
LC,But it's actually a question related to that. I'm sorry.,,,SC1 11.17,"I think it would be better and then when we talk about the
tools we- we can already analyze the tools so it will be like-"
AS,"OK, you're quiet again, LC.",,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, yeah."
LC,"Oh, sorry. Thank you. So actually a question related to that would be like, could be like what's the state of their research or what is the current status of their research regarding what you said, AS, ",,,SC1 11.17,"tool #1, and then this is based on rubrics."
AI,External external scripts.,,,SC1 11.17,Yeah.
LC,"Yeah, like, yeah. And that could be a question that could be answered with our analysis.",,,SC1 11.17,"Yes yes yes, I agree."
AS,"Oh, what we already have.",,P,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, I think this is a good idea."
AI,"just so quick something that I read about was the script theory of guidance, if you also came across that. And I think that is what's like, relevant to worry about the like internal external script part. I think. Because that would be exactly, it explained the four parts which were like the play, the scene, the script and the role and that was like, I think I'm just saying that this is the thing that we're focusing on right now, right?",,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, so we can do it this way, so we can just remove this
section because our- our paper is slightly different."
AS,"Yeah, it seems like it.",,,SC1 11.17,Yeah. And I think we can also delete the recommendations for future research.
AI,"If the IT was described as how would help, How would you use external scripts to help the students whose internal scripts aren't as well developed or for collaboration, at least that's a caveat. It was explicitly for collaboration, It wasn't for knowledge transfer. Is that what we're focusing on?",,,SC1 11.17,We can combine it together here on discussions.
HA,Kind of like using external script to support student who have low structure internal script ,,,SC1 11.17,Yeah.
AS,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,(inaudible) one paragraph would do.
AI,"Because then uh, the script theory of guidance is something that I've seen pop up as a keyword sometimes. So maybe we could focus on that as well.",,,SC1 11.17,Yeah.
AS,"I cause yeah the articles I read didn't. I can't. I couldn't tell you if you specifically used those. But yeah, it was a it was a lot about yeah, the collaborative learning to create or promote internal scripting.",,,SC1 11.17,Yeah.
HA,Mhm,,,SC1 11.17,OK. So.
AI,All right. I can just do this by the way just so you know what I…,,,SC1 11.17,"And I mean for the 17th of December, we just need our first
draft. We still have time after this to complete our article."
HA,create or…so our research question will be how to…I'm not sure how to develop internal script inside learner during CSCL by using external... I'm not sure.,,,SC1 11.17,"Yes, yes. You remember correctly, Essi said that it's somewhere in the- in January, it should be final."
AS,"Yeah, I think it's like how to transfer external scripts into internal scripts. Unless I'm wrong, I I I don't know what you guys don't.",,,SC1 11.17,Yeah.
AI,"Yeah, I just transfer xxx",,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, and the 3rd of January I think."
LC,"the question, the question cannot be how to",,,SC1 11.17,Are we supposed to look at the- FROCOLE and check the?
AS,Mhm,,P,SC1 11.17,I already had a look and I think we are good or we're doing good. I haven't seen any problem.
LC,Because we're not going to prove anything like we want to do any kind of premium. The question should be what are those people saying about it?,,P,SC1 11.17,"OK, that's good. So we are not activated to do anything."
HA,"Yeah, yeah",,,SC1 11.17,Yeah.
LC,Like what's the current status of this Or ,,,SC1 11.17,OK.
AS,Mhm,,,SC1 11.17,"So the deadline is (inaudible). OK, yeah, so the final drafts are by next Tuesday."
HA,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,Mhm.
LC,"Like point out directly through what is the thing we can answer, which is what are other people saying about it.",,,SC1 11.17,"So we have to… I would like to set a deadline where we’ve finished the pros and c- the analysis part. Do we need another session to go through the whole thing? Because there's still the discussion, so Kofi will be working on the discussion, or? How do we want to do the discussion? Our next meeting, we will write it together or?"
AS,So what are some methodologies that exist.,,,SC1 11.17,What do you think Kofi? Are you able to?
LC,Yeah. For… ,,,SC1 11.17,Or you can drop something out first.
AS,"Which method, Internal scripts they could external scripts into internal scripts like that?",,,SC1 11.17,"Prepare, yeah, draft, draft discussion."
LC,Yeah. Exactly.,,,SC1 11.17,And then we can discuss more during our next meeting.
AS,"OK, I'll write that in the chat. What are…its current…",,,SC1 11.17,OK.
AI,"I don't know if you can say it like in external scripts into internal scripts, because there's not like a change. It's just that these external scripts help you develop your own internal scripts. They don't like 1 doesn't turn into the other or transfer into the other. It's more like how do they help support or yeah.",,,SC1 11.17,"What do you think? It's not so difficult for you, or?"
HA,"Yeah, (inaudible, interrupted)",,,SC1 11.17,I don't know.
AS,"External scripts support in the creation, creation?",,,SC1 11.17,"I think he will only be able to go only a bit more after we write our pros and cons, right?"
AI,"Development I think is because you do have an internal script already. Maybe it's just like on a lower level or on a higher level, but external scripts are supposed to help you with those, ",,,SC1 11.17,"Yes, yes."
AS,"Should we say, through collaboration?",,,SC1 11.17,Right.
HA,"Umm, Computer support, collaborate, ",,,SC1 11.17,"So then, yeah, I'll make sure to at least getting something
simple."
AI,Collaboration…Those groups are apparently specified for collaboration anyway. But I don't know.,,,SC1 11.17,So I do-
AS,"OK, I'll just gonna write it down. Ah EN has written something else. His is a distinction between external and internal scripts in CSCL.",,,SC1 11.17,Maybe- Go ahead.
AI,Hmm (sigh) xxx topic,,,SC1 11.17,Kofi can- can read through all of our stuff and. Yeah.
LC,"Yeah, we should notice that difference. It's it's CSCL. It's not any other kind of collaboration.",,,SC1 11.17,"For example, if we, uh, for- till next- till this Tuesday, till 8-9- ninth December can finalize our thoughts?"
AS,OK,,,SC1 11.17,Uh-huh.
AI,"Oh, OK. All right.",,,SC1 11.17,OK.
AS,"Yeah. Because it could be in anything else. It could be in like classroom settings, right. But it has to be in CSCL. Yeah.",,,SC1 11.17,"Ah, Kofi, uh has four 4-5 days to make some initial draft of discussion and limitation."
HA,"Yeah. So like in the book that I send you the picture on the on WhatsApp, like they did mention a lot about the interplay even when like is back in 2007. But one of my question is that like do we really need to like focus on five here recently? Because they in the past they they have like many valuable thing to read about that topic so.",,,SC1 11.17,"And also, like, uh? Kofi, like feel free to…"
AS,"Well, even Maria said she did. They did this from 2000 to 2020.",,,SC1 11.17,"Cut (inaudible), edit."
HA,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,"And comment anything, yeah."
LC,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,"(inaudible) to us. Like our parts, if you have questions too, because this is kind of like a harder thing to write about, (inaudible) the whole big picture."
HA,"They have very much findings back in that time so we we should, ",,,SC1 11.17,"Yes, you’re big picture owner."
AS,"Yeah, I think we're gonna have to, to be honest, 'cause I think we're gonna have very limited resources if you stick to only the 1st these last five years because like there were so many articles that I saw that I just didn't even read because it was like 2002, 2003. But I think we're gonna have to go back to those now. Just for number's sake as well.",,,SC1 11.17,"Do you have the big picture? Do you want to clarify any
things? Are you (inaudible) after we had written our tools, maybe?"
LC,"Yeah, agree.",,,SC1 11.17,It’s a good idea to me.
HA,"Yeah, I'll try to send you the what? The contents of the book.",,P,SC1 11.17,(laughing)
AS,"Hey, so the thing that you sent us, AI, the FROCOLE, that's what we have to download, right?",,P,SC1 11.17,Yeah
AI,"Yeah. I think LC couldn't download it, so I thought maybe if I post it there, it would help her. So you don't have to think about it.",,,SC1 11.17,"Oh yeah, yeah yeah yeah. Just have to read through and then… No, it won't be a big deal."
AS,OK.,,,SC1 11.17,But I think it's very important deal to summarize.
AI,"But the thing below that, Please note that that is the, what's it called? Script theory of guidance. Yeah, I think that is something…",,,SC1 11.17,Summarize yeah.
AS,"that's not, that's not anything that's just I can't click on that.",,,SC1 11.17,So the four of us will get our analysis done by Thursday.
AI,It's not clickable. It's just text.,,,SC1 11.17,Yes.
AS,"Oh, OK ",,,SC1 11.17,Yeah.
AI,Sure go ahead ,,,SC1 11.17,"Right and then Kofi, you can start working on the sorting 
everything and. Yeah."
AS,I'm old. ,,,SC1 11.17,Alright.
AI,"No, it's cool. I'm trying to see if I can find more articles about that specific operation. Just actually kind of hard.",,,SC1 11.17,"I guess like this, is this alright?"
HA,So we kind of agree that our question would be what our current methodology for having external script support in the development of Internet script?,,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, yeah."
AS,Yeah,,P,SC1 11.17,At this point I want to note that on next Monday I won't be available and as I will be in Lapland.
HA,"Yeah, we can continue that way. So, but we need to put the in the context of computer based collaboration?",,P,SC1 11.17,"Oh yeah, your trip."
AS,Yeah. So I'm just trying to download this thing before I forget you need… ,,,SC1 11.17,Maybe we change date- meeting date? What do you think?
AI,"Oh yeah, you need to also read the instruction for how to use it and create an account because it's not user friendly.",,,SC1 11.17,"I will be in Lapland from Thursday to Wednesday next week, but if there's a- there are some problems, I have my laptop with me and I can just log in."
AS,"Oh, that's great. Another thing for me to think about ",,,SC1 11.17,"OK, I see."
AI,(reading something) Interplay…all right. That is literally a whole chapter about that. 20 pages.,,P,SC1 11.17,"And I’m going to do my stuff, um, so don't worry. Uhm, I’ll get it sorted."
HA,"Yeah. And like this, you know, this author Kollar, like wrote a lot about this. Like when I put the keyword, I always see his or her name.",,,SC1 11.17,"OK. So we do our part first and then the final? Anyway, after the first draft we have time to work on it again."
AS,"Yeah, I've seen that name too. ",,,SC1 11.17,Uh-huh.
HA," Like in our faculty, you know like there is a professor that she kind of like research about like  like forever.",,,SC1 11.17,"Maybe like Katharina, you can just, like, look through on Monday or just some- if you have any comments you can just put there and we will…"
AS,"I found two books that that professor Helmut Niegemann wrote either a chapter for or wrote like the introduction for, I'm like, OK, this guy is somebody",,,SC1 11.17,Yeah.
AI,Jesus ,,,SC1 11.17,Yeah.
LC,"Yeah, they're famous. They're the rock stars of CSCL.",,,SC1 11.17,Yeah.
AS,"Yeah. Looks like he's been around for a while somewhere from like 1996 and stuff. I was like, oh, OK ",,,SC1 11.17,We'll just let you know when we have like a brief draft of it.
LC,Yeah ,,,SC1 11.17,Yeah.
AS,"You guys. Some of you guys were not even born then, weren’t you? Ahh.",,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, OK, so I think, anything else?"
LC,I think I was already born.,,,SC1 11.17,"Also. Uh, not regarding our article, but general regarding this course. My classmates shared with me or with- in our WhatsApp group. Are related to their work in small groups and two groups. Uh, highlighted that they don't have so good collaboration. For example, because a teachers- supervisors- supervisors could intervene in their work and assign for them additional- additional worklike separate analytics."
AI,1995?,,P,SC1 11.17,I see.
AS,1996,,P,SC1 11.17,Hopefully that we have very good collaboration as I see. Thank you so much.
AI,"Nope, I wasn't born yet.",,P,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, (inaudible)."
AS,"Oh, jeez. ",,P,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, that's good. Yeah. Maybe because Essi can't, uh, participate in our Monday meetings."
AI,"So to if we go through the questions that we had to answer, right, choose a specific topic, we said, well, scripts, obviously. And then internal, external scripts right?",,,SC1 11.17,"By the way, we we, we have 2 device per- we meet twice per week."
AS,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,Ah.
AI,Then define and decide and define your questions or prom that you will focus on. And we said we want the…,,,SC1 11.17,Maybe it- it helps us because other groups made only one- once.
AS,I think what HA word in the chat is a really good.,,,SC1 11.17,Mhm
AI, Current methodologies for external support development of… yeah OK so how do external scripts help develop internal scripts but not how. And then decide and define aim what's our aim with this research paper to give an overview?,,,SC1 11.17,Mhm
AS,To demonstrate that like demonstrate how it what what they are is it not? I don't know.,,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, so how we used to- are we going to meet on Thursday or we just leave our things up there on Thursday?"
LC,No. We're ,,,SC1 11.17,"Uhm? Maybe we can plan to meet, but in-"
AI, Findings?,,,SC1 11.17,"OK, and we'll see how it goes."
LC,"We're either…yeah, gathering findings and analyzing. So to to make a review or to review articles, we are not demonstrating because we're not the ones doing the experiment. So, yeah, I mean, I'm sorry. I'm…sometimes I say too much, too many things about it, like methodology, but in my…",,,SC1 11.17,Yeah.
AS,"No, you seem to know the most LC ",,,SC1 11.17,Yeah.
AI,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,"OK sure, but um, Katharina you will be gone on Thursday
already, right?"
HA,I need that.,,,SC1 11.17,"Umm, Thursday evening, um. So, at 10 I have a
presentation on workplace learning."
AI,We trust you ,,,SC1 11.17,Oh.
AS,Yeah. Because ,,,SC1 11.17,"I think it can be hard, but I- I will try, if you send a meeting 
I’ll try to come."
HA,We have no background.,,,SC1 11.17,"OK, so we can plan the Thursday meeting, what time is good for you all?"
AS,"If we fail, it's your fault, but keep going ",,,SC1 11.17,Mmm.
AI,"Yeah, exactly.",,,SC1 11.17,I have a class. Just a moment I check.
LC,Okay ,,,SC1 11.17,"I know someone has some- Is it Galina, you have the class? (inaudible)."
HA,We will kill you. ,,,SC1 11.17,"Yes, the- just a moment I check my schedule. Uh, so I'm free from 12 till 4."
AS,But you seem to know what you're talking about LC. Keep going.,,,SC1 11.17,"Twelve to four, OK."
LC,"OK, so the the one of the objectives could be like to depict the…how do you call it the current, the current…I forgot the word",,,SC1 11.17,I'm free this time afternoon.
AI,State?,,,SC1 11.17,And Anthony?
AS,Depict?,,,SC1 11.17,Maybe 12 is good?
HA,Take your time,,,SC1 11.17,OK.
LC,"Depict or like show the current state or the current…yeah, I don't know how I have to say it ",,,SC1 11.17,"Uh, I think I have my presentation- I'm not sure if it's 10 or 12. I have to check."
AS,"State, state is correct.",,,SC1 11.17,OK.
LC,"state of the research like the current research that they have on the topic or the current methodologies they use to implement the the transition between internal, internal, ",,,SC1 11.17,I’ll let you know in the WhatsApp group.
AS,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,"OK, so either we can leave 12 first, then if your presentations at 12 maybe two, I don't know."
AI,"Methods use…and then there's also the part where we want to add our own kind of perspective on it, right?",,,SC1 11.17,And what's Kofi?
AS,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,"Kofi, is 12 OK?"
HA,Is that the implication application?,,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, on Thursday, right?"
AS,The what? Sorry?,,,SC1 11.17,Yes.
HA,Is that the implication part that Maria suggests?,,,SC1 11.17,Uh-huh.
AS,"Yeah, I think that is what that is. I see, again, let's go from the, but I still think like that article that I write, a gamification will fit there. So I think that's where it's going. I don't know if you guys disagree with me or not, but like it is like like like if you read the article it, it really talks about that.",,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, so we put 12, noon, first and if, uh, Katharina, you can check for us and if we need, we can shift to two or something."
AI,Like can you quickly and shortly like exactly explain why the why it fits ,,,SC1 11.17,Yeah.
AS,"Because because they talk about how in games, like when you're doing gamification in in in technology based classrooms, the external scripts are, you know, the, the the rules of the games, how to play the games but they become internal because as you level up all of the levels are similar. So the students already know how to do all of the actions from level to level. Similarly, if you fail a level, you get to redo it. So is. Yeah. Whereas in a regular like test or something if you fail, you just fail, you don't, there's no redo. But since you get to redo it in these ones, you already know what to expect, what's coming. So you internalize the structure of the of the of the levels, basically. Yeah, things like that. There's more to it. But yeah, I don't know if you guys disagree.",,,SC1 11.17,"OK, I think that's good. We will work on our parts and we just, I think what’s coming up is the part that's hard."
AI,"Yeah, I wonder if it's exactly the same as what I was thinking. Because what I what I read about the scripts was that was more about like teaching the collaborative process like ",,P,SC1 11.17,Cool.
LC,Yeah. And regulation.,,P,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, OK, I think we are good. Alright so bye."
AS,"Yeah, and that's that's in there too. And that’s  when you have these games that the students can play together, they are helping each other and teaching each other what to do. And they're also the the internal scripts come before because they talk about human nature and human beings are kind of born to play. So they already know like there's all of these internal scripts about like rules of a game and how to play fair and all of these things that are already exist. So then when you're playing these games with your classmates or your peers, then you kind of build those struct, reinforce those structures that already exist in US and then specify to the game the CSCL based game that you have in a classroom or in a learning environment.",,P,SC1 11.17,"Okay, thank you so much."
AI,"I mean, you sold it to me. I'm in like I think, yeah, that makes sense. It's a fun addition as well to make it not as try and boring.",,,SC1 11.17,Yeah.
AS,"That's what I was thinking as well. I think we should add something like real because again this is one that Niegeman wrote like like he like he had a part, a part in this. So I think if we kind of include something that somebody within this field in this program is, I don't know, thinking like that, what does everybody else think?",,P,SC1 11.17,Thank you.
LC,"I it sounds nice so I would agree to put it on well we should be really careful with the exclusion criteria like why or or exclusion criteria in this case why are we putting this with the other it it doesn't came up with the keywords we agreed. Just to be clear on the methodology, like I like it but then we should like really explain why this can come to and if this can come to then maybe there are some other similar to the to this one. So maybe we should rethink the keywords like because like for an article to be accepted in a real nice journal, the methodology of how did we get the results we get should be super clear. It can be just like, I mean it sounds nice so I'm going to put it. I thought this one sounds nice so yeah, we want to put it, but we cannot say that in the paper.",,,SC1 11.17,Bye bye.
AS,"But I did search for the keywords. That's the thing, right? Like, I I understand what you're saying though, LC. Like, I like, like is it, is it something that we're putting in...I guess my question then is we are not allowed to make a connection ourselves. We have to follow what already exists and how do you have innovation?",,P,SC1 11.17,"Thank you, have a nice evening."
LC,"No, no, no. We can of course like come up with new things, but since we're doing a literature review, like the methodology we like people use to do methodology, like literature review, it's literally it's a systematic search for information. So you like if someone else in China or in Colombia wants to do the same exact search, they should be able to find the same articles we came up with.",,P,SC1 11.17,"You too, and hyvää itsenäisyyspäivää."
AS,Mhm,,P,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, you're right."
LC,"And if if someone else, if we were to publish this in real life, are we supposed to publish this in real life?",,P,SC1 11.17,Is there anything happening? I- I didn't go out. I was doing my essay.
AS, (shaking his head),,,SC1 11.17,"Uh, I just saw that they have some lights, umm, on- on the way to the Turku city center, but I don't know if there's
anything."
LC,"No. OK, ",,,SC1 11.17,I think it should be some in Yle-Arena. Some performance in the evening.
AI,Why xxx ,,,SC1 11.17,Mhm.
LC,"If we were supposed to publish this in real life, like, what the what the what the peer review does is like a professor or whoever is like, they go to the Internet and they literally try to look with the keywords we choose, if they can find the exact same thing and if they can, then we did it, right.",,,SC1 11.17,OK.
AS,"Yeah, I, I, I see what you're saying, but I think I'm like just focusing. Maybe I'm wrong, but I I'm focusing on what Maria has said, though. It's like this is some like that very important thing where we're we're creating our own. What did she say?",,,SC1 11.17,"Alright, sounds great."
AI,Overview?,,,SC1 11.17,"Uh, maybe 7:30, if I remember correctly."
AS,"Yeah, we're…what did she say…oh, it's gone now. I wrote in the text, right What's up group.",,,SC1 11.17,"Oh, OK."
HA,"By the way, I need, I think I need to go in five or 10 minutes, ",,P,SC1 11.17,"But it's the same for me, Hui Ni, I don't get- go out because of all the essays we have"
AS,"OK, yeah, she said ”try to come up with some new directions, with future research, new ideas” So I don't see how we could stay as a pure whatever this I can't remember the name now of what we're doing, but ",,P,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, and- and you have to finish everything before you go, right?"
LC,"Because that comes later, like in the in the discussion.",,P,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, you're right."
AS,"Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.",,P,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, you're busy working on our essay."
HA,Yeah.,,P,SC1 11.17,But we will be fine.
LC,"After you gather a bunch of articles related to this random topic, then in the discussion you say, like, I found this. And what we as a group think is that there are some new directions that should be stored. And that all goes in the discussion. Like after.",,P,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, you'll enjoy after Thursday"
AS,"Yeah. OK. That's what I was talking about. I think we're OK Yeah. I don't. I don't mean in that first part. Yeah. Because I agree with you. That first part should just be like each of us finds two articles that discuss this, the scripts internal, external and yeah, and basically our ",,,SC1 11.17,"And you- and you Kofi, uh, how you… warm here?"
AI,"Not only two, we need to find way more than extracts and then well, ",,,SC1 11.17,How am I warm?
AS,We have to really read two ,,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, well how- I don't know how to say. How you cope with this cold weather?"
AI,"I mean, one I read two articles and then I found out that one of them was based on the other. So officially I think I read one, but it is, it was a good one. That was nice. Yeah. I think the question was answered right or the confusion was clear. So you can still use your article and I think it actually would be nice for the discussion part when we can say, oh, by the way, gamification is also the thing that really helps with scripting.",,,SC1 11.17,"Oh, I just got some new clothes."
AS,"Yeah, it seems.",,,SC1 11.17,What- what?
LC,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,Put on like 3-4 clothes at the same time and wear my jacket.
AS,"Yeah, like it seems to be a way of the future to to kind of answer this or look into this question of how to go from external to internal, something like that. I don't know. We'll see how it goes.",,,SC1 11.17,OK.
AI,"Right. There was also this topic about whether CSCL scripts kind of diminish motivation because it's like you get like guided through the whole process and if it's too much, if it's over scripting, then your motivation kind of goes down because it's too much but then, if it's not enough instruction, then your motivation also goes down and I think games might be a good idea to kind of keep that motivation stable.",,,SC1 11.17,Are your rooms also cold? Because my room isn't very warm.
AS,"That's what this is the article, too, actually. ",,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, I have an extra heater here so I'm fine, yeah."
AI,Here we go! Nice. That's smart. ,,,SC1 11.17,Oh. OK. Alright.
AS,Yeah. Look at you. Did you write that article? ,,,SC1 11.17,"But then the weather is bad. It's not good for studies. Not
at all."
AI,"(grinning jokingly) No, I wasn't. I wasn't born yet. ",,,SC1 11.17,Mhm.
AS,That's true. ,,,SC1 11.17,Yeah.
AI,"All right, so we have the aim that we had, right? So depict current research with the topic and the methods and then implicate something that we don't know yet, but what we find. And then the next point would be the site and the finer context. The context would be scripts? CSCL scripts? Is that it?",,,SC1 11.17,"(inaudible) wearing a few layers, right?"
HA,...context xxx,,,SC1 11.17,Come again?
AI,School settings? Do we want to do like just school settings? I I think that's something…,,,SC1 11.17,"You’re still wearing a few layers of clothes, right?"
AS,I think that would be most practical. LC you tell us where we go. ,,,SC1 11.17,"Oh Oh yeah, yeah."
LC," Oh my gosh, yeah, I guess it could be school setting. Maybe we should like for just our mental health just include also like high education like you know universities or whatever ",,P,SC1 11.17,And maybe sauna can help you
AI,Mhm,,P,SC1 11.17,Yeah. That's a great idea.
AS,Educational environments? So then we can try to,,P,SC1 11.17,(laughing)
LC,Yeah so,,P,SC1 11.17,I've never been to the sauna before.
HA,So it's like is both the kind of like school and also higher education or only like school students or only higher student or both of them. The context do you want to kind of limit it by mail valid or like all of the on forms at school and university and educational institutions?,,,SC1 11.17,Why?
AI,"I think we should stay with educational institutions overall because if we make it more specific, it's harder to find articles that stick that as well. The educational background, I think, Yeah.",,,SC1 11.17,But-
HA,"Hmm and yeah, but like it's educational environment and kind of academic, not non academic training or things like that, just academic.",,,SC1 11.17,You should go.
AS,Hmm,,,SC1 11.17,"We have a sauna in our building. You just have to go up one- one floor, then there's this-"
HA,"Yeah, because sometimes like like some people, they do the research on non-academic trainings, maybe not relevant.",,,SC1 11.17,"Oh, but that's just your building?"
LC,"Yeah, you're right.",,P,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, I think I see people go often. I don't even know how it works."
HA,I get the point,,P,SC1 11.17,"You just need to book it online and then you have an hour
and then just go in and sweat a little bit."
LC,Maybe we could narrow it to just academic environment. Plus I didn't find many things about non like informal education. I don't know if you found something like relevant. So,,P,SC1 11.17,Oh.
AS,"Yeah, I haven't seen anything either.",,,SC1 11.17,Maybe- 
HA,"Me too. I just like I found some research but another topic on the non formal training, but not not popular. Not that popular.",,,SC1 11.17,"And after- after this, umm, you have to come to dip into the
cold water. Just put the water really cold and then, umm. 
Yeah. Yeah."
AI,"All right. And then if we're happy with the context, the last part would then just be to search and read articles. So I think we have the questions done for now and we then should all try to find as many articles relating to this topic as we can, right?",,,SC1 11.17,Oh.
HA,So what is the target number of articles that we should create?,,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, put it on cold and then it's good for your, uh, how do we say it?"
AI,"We we don't have to read all of them. I think we just collect them and then look through the abstracts to see which one fit our criteria that we kind of decide at a later point maybe. And then yeah, ",,,SC1 11.17,Circulation.
HA,Okay. So what is target number for all of us?,,,SC1 11.17,Yeah.
AS,"Well, Maria did. How many again?",,P,SC1 11.17,Yes. I am- I also can recommend you go to the sauna. Maybe today
AI,Thirty six,,P,SC1 11.17,Today?
AS,"Thirty six. So how many? There's five of us. So if we do six, No, wait, I can't do math. So seven each?",,,SC1 11.17,Just check availability at your system.
HA,"Yeah. And I think, like, just set a target number for all of us and then try to buy as many as we can sometime like, if there are some overlapping, it's OK, Just put it there and then we can, like, find more.",,P,SC1 11.17,"Uh, I'll try. I'll try something. Yeah."
AS,"Yeah, Yeah. It doesn't have to be. We don't have to exactly follow her number. And even if there are some that are similar, that's actually a good thing because it shows that's that different research has the same results or…",,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, so we are supposed to do the rating after this right? 
Every meeting. Is that right? For the FROCOLE?"
AI,"Kind of, yeah, I'm just thinking, so we can still use the Excel sheet, right?",,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, you're right. Yeah, thanks for reminder."
AS,Mhm,,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, yeah."
AI,"And then we can just put in, yeah, just collect more articles in that. So you know we don't like overlap with the don't do the same article twice ",,,SC1 11.17,"Yeah, so yeah, I'll just yeah, I'll remind the group so we all
do, yeah. OK, I think that's about it. We can work on our parts."
LC,"Yeah yeah, just don’t double our own work. Oh oh, one thing that I think it's important like in the like when we're describing methodology, we should only look for empirical data like not other reviews ",,,SC1 11.17,Yep.
HA,Ahhh,,P,SC1 11.17,"Yes, thank you."
LC,Because we'll actually out review it's gonna be like this. They're already getting to their own conclusion. So only like empirical data.,,P,SC1 11.17,OK bye bye.
AS,Yeah.,,P,SC1 11.17,"Thank you, bye."
AI,"How do I know if something is empirical data, if it's peer reviewed and a little bit or in an Official Journal?",,,SC1 11.17,Bye.
LC,Oh OK. I mean there are two kinds of articles or like papers in general. Empirical data and review. The empirical data is literally making experiments. Like we use these special software and we gather Terry kids in a classroom and we gave them this software so they can try it on and we saw the results. That's empirical data. And then the reviews is like we'll look for a bunch of articles and we made our conclusions based on that.,,,SC1 11.17,Bye.
AS,So we're doing a review and we have,,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"yeah, we're doing that for empirical data.",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,"Oh, so I can't use, like, the article that already collected a bunch of articles and just came to its own conclusion.",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"Well, if there's a way, I think that if you could look at that review and try to find one of the articles in that review, then we could, yeah, also use that article, just not be available.",,,SC1 11.17,
LC,Yeah that’s the,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Oh,,,SC1 11.17,
HA,Happy to have LC.,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"What's that, LC?",,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"Oh, no, I just said that that's the best thing you can do. Like so for other reviews.",,,SC1 11.17,
HA,"OK, all right. So do I understand right that we only find empirical articles? And also in the like method part, we should like, tell, tell them that, like when we search for their article, one of the criteria is that we focus on the empirical articles.",,,SC1 11.17,
LC,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,
HA,OK,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"LC, you're out again.",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,"No, no, she's just said, yeah, the other thing was background noise, I think. Yeah, it's fun in the restaurant, isn't it?",,,SC1 11.17,
HA,"Yeah. So this article, the author will be LC et al. ",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,"Yeah, definitely. xxx music by LC video by LC text by . Yeah, but it's great that you have an understanding because we don't fully like we haven't read as many research papers as you like.",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"Yeah. I've only ever done argumentative papers, like, my mind was always in that, like thinking in that direction. What's something that we can connect two things together and find something new to to go forward with. Yeah, so let's like, if I could just be clear about something as well then. So we are going to When is this due?",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,"That's a good question. Do you remember what our tasks for next week would be? Because by this week, I think we need to finish with the first couple of questions that we're like, find the aim and define your problem right?",,,SC1 11.17,
HA,Mhm,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,"So maybe we should try to collect all the articles by the end of this week, you know",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,
HA,"Only the title, I don't need to analyze it right? Only like, kind of the list?",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,I think we can…,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"I think we need to move faster to be honest with you guys, I think we should go beyond the title, and I think we should try to find that empirical information that they give and then when we meet again, 'cause for me, it's a little bit strange writing a paper together.",,,SC1 11.17,
HA,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"So I like, I think we're gonna actually have to physically write it together, like meet and write it. Like we can do the empirical research on our own and then gather the facts and figures the numbers on our own. But then once we're physically writing it, like, I don't know, I've never written a paper with other people before, so I don't know how to I go about that.",,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"Hi again, I think that's why it's super important to actually do the excel sheet super specifically. Like like make it understandable to everyone because I'm not gonna read all the articles and I'm sure you won't read the all the articles either. So we literally have to make it super easy for others to understand what's going on in these articles. So like we can all get to conclusions from those, you know, and then it's just like a matter of maybe some like one can do the introduction and then the other can do the results and so on. And then what we will have to do is like actually super consciously read what the other wrote and make corrections and modifications if necessary.",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,"But would you then say that we still need to read all the articles? Like, read all of it? Because if we want to collect as many articles, we obviously can't read them all, right?",,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"No, no, no. We don't have to read them all. Yeah, each one will read, I don't know, five or something, 7, whatever. And then like if if I'm going to do the the conclusions, then I'll have to really dig into the like, well, that's what we're gonna conclude about it. But if someone else is gonna do the introduction, then maybe they doesn't need to actually read all these articles but like look for more theory to, you know, to do the introduction and so on. I don't know if I'm making myself clear",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,"It's just that so we still would then need to read five article each like full article because the way Maria described it, is that OK Read just the abstract and only then some articles fully.  And that's the question I have, because we obviously can collect all the data if we just read the abstracts.",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"It has to match, right? Like, I I see what you're saying. Yeah, jeez, that's tough.",,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"Well, I think we can come to conclusions just reading the abstracts. Because in a like in an empirical paper the abstract is literally we did this experiment with this. How many people and their results were this and that. And then if we want more information we just gotta go to the discussion of the article and there they might be saying something interesting like we think this could go in this new direction or with this, but we should have done that.",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,"Do you then want us to like, collect all the data that was in the discussion for this article like? Should we read that part explicitly and then collect the data and write that in the spreadsheet?",,,SC1 11.17,
LC,Yeah. Like what I what I do and what I did in this in the Excel sheet was literally just read the summary or the ,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,"Mhm, abstract? introduction?",,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"Yeah, thank you. So just read the abstract and get the most important things from there. And then if there was something that was not clear enough or that maybe the topic was really, really interesting, then I would go to the discussion and just quickly read like just trying to scan for more important information.",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"When we're presenting the information though, like are are we gonna have to present numbers or just conclusions?",,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"I think the Excel sheet is can actually be put in there like because that's like those are the results. Like if we were going to make an interview, then we will have to put the transcript somewhere. We're not making an interview, we're just literally searching. So we have to show what did we look for and what did we find.",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,OK,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Mhm,,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"So putting an excel sheet, well, not excel sheet, but like something",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,the data from it.,,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"Yeah, yeah,",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"if I could just reiterate my question so like when we're writing our own paper, are we saying that, oh, we read this article and these researchers use this many people and got this conclusion? Or are we saying we read X amount of articles and this many got this conclusion where this many got this other conclusion?",,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"What? Sorry, how was the question?",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"OK, so like I think it's a question about details. I think it's similar to what AI's asking. I don't know, I'm not sure, but like like like it's it's about how much detail we're getting from the articles that we're reading. Like are we are we trying to get the information from the article just about the conclusions that the that the empirical research garnered or are we getting from the articles the how they actually conducted their experiments.",,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"I think we can talk about like the how can be put on the little table that we make, like the methodology they use because maybe some researchers used in class activities and other used, I don't know, homework, whatever, You know, something that could be important, you know",,,SC1 11.17,
HA,"Yeah, the context?",,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"yeah, I think it depends. A lot of what we find is important. And then like when we have all the important parts of all the articles, we can start categorizing like, oh, we found that 10 out of theory articles use the same methodology, like the same kind of experiment.",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"OK, that was my question. So that's where our numbers come from. Our numbers come from, this many articles did this or this many articles found this. This many articles used this.",,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"Yeah, exactly.",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Then I have a question ,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,Professor LC ,,,SC1 11.17,
LC,Oh my God. ,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,"It's just if we then like want to collect exact data. Like for example, this research paper used tried 30 participants and gave them homework, we do need to read the papers more thoroughly. It's not just like skimming through them, right?",,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"And yeah, but probably at that point we can start dividing tasks like we like. What I can imagine right now is like we might be able to find three or four different main points or main categories, you know. So of course we won't read with detail all four, you know, go through all four categories with detail but we're gonna, like, divide. We're gonna do the homework, you know, category. And then you will have probably to read like the two or three or four like articles, like, really, really in detail. Or scan them just to, you know, to get a broader idea and to be able to write a conclusion about it.",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"Yeah. Or they might have a table in the article. And that gives us, like, the direct information.",,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"Yeah. Yeah, exactly.",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,All right. ,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"But if I could just. Yeah, go ahead. HA, you have…",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,"No, I just wanted to say that I probably just need to work on my skimming skills.",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,In the paper,,,SC1 11.17,
HA,I think I should go like very soon. Yeah. So but like…,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"I was gonna say before we leave, like I just want to write down what we should gather from the articles that we read, #1 should be the methodologies, right? Methodologies that the researchers used.",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Participants,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,the types of participants?,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,"types, numbers, if there's any information on them at all.",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"Numbers of participants, what else?",,,SC1 11.17,
HA,Findings.,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"Findings. Yeah. Findings and conclusions, right.",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,
LC,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,
HA,"Yeah. But like I I have a question like yeah, with this way we're just like list out what they did and like what they find. But I did read some kind of literature review. They they divide the research question into smaller parts and then like they will analyze like it in terms of this aspect, these guys say that. But meanwhile that guy said this and like yeah. And give some of our comment on that and then go to the second aspect like in terms of this aspect, this guy said that for example when I read about the emotion regulation in entrepreneurship. So one part they said that in terms of the effect of positive emotion, this research say that, this research say that and then give some out some comment And then the next part in term of their negative emotion and they say that. So kind of divine it based on our like idea of. Yeah.",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,So I think it's not using that article.,,,SC1 11.17,
HA,Sorry?,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"No, I'm just making a joke.",,,SC1 11.17,
HA,"Yeah, it's kind of topic and subtopic.",,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"We could organize it like that. Like if we find that's what we need to read, like first this first article and try to find category.",,,SC1 11.17,
HA,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"Because like if we find that a considerable amount of papers contain the terms emotions, then we can like conclude like these others said this about emotions and this other other said this other thing about emotions. And we're like, you know, like there's like similarities among all the articles or the similarities and we should point that out.",,,SC1 11.17,
HA,So what we should do when we find and read the article in the following time is that we try to find the keywords of the subtopic and the categories and yeah ,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"yeah I'm trying to write this down right now. She's just so I can write it in the in the chat so we all have the same. So I said what we should gather from the articles we read are #1 methodologies that the researchers used number two types slash numbers of participants, #3 findings and conclusions. Is there a #4 like ",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Maybe…,,,SC1 11.17,
LC,that main points or subcategories?,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"Main points and subcategories. OK, yeah.",,,SC1 11.17,
HA,So is that the columns for the spreadsheet? Numbers?,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Yeah you can add them to the spreadsheet.,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, we can do that. And then anything else though #5 Or is that ",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,technology used.,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,Technology used?,,,SC1 11.17,
HA,number six.,,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"Yeah, maybe. Oh, oh, you know what? New, new outcomes or like new possible directions or whatever that they offer.",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"Oh, future, future outcomes? Yeah, future directions.",,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"Yeah, yeah",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"OK, future directions.",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,"Do you mean what the authors usually say like, oh, this is what you could do with the state or that?",,,SC1 11.17,
LC,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,"yeah, OK, good.",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"And then within the within the keywords of internal scripts, external scripts?",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,"nothing, just that, ",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,just those?,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,"I think, yeah, that's what we're trying to focus on with the research question so.",,,SC1 11.17,
HA,Yeah. In the chat Ebu Bay said that we could create a Microsoft document and share parts for everyone to write. I guess. I think that's what I we are doing.,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,Yeah. I think we're starting with the spreadsheet and then moving from there.,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Do you want to do a new spreadsheet? Because the old one includes data that isn't empirical?,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,Yeah.,,,SC1 11.17,
HA,Just keep it there and start a new.,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"Yeah, keep that one there and then we can come back script.",,,SC1 11.17,
LC,Yes,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,Yeah. So I'm just gonna press enter.,,,SC1 11.17,
LC,Oh you know what else?,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,What?,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Hmm,,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"Guys, on the well, on this one or in the new spreadsheet, let's put the references and the URL, just to make it easier to reference later.",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Yeah.,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,Yeah. So it's save time later.,,,SC1 11.17,
HA,So we should put the reference seat in the APA form.,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Yeah. If you can. That'd be nice.,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"I found a lot of articles at the top. They actually give it to you. They're like if you want to reference, here's how you do it. Like, sweet copy paste and done.",,,SC1 11.17,
LC,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Sweet,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,Yeah. I guess I'm gonna press enter on this. No?,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Yeah.,,,SC1 11.17,
HA,So is there any deadline? And what about next meeting?,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"Yeah. What's. Yeah, I want to move faster on this. I feel a little bit nervous about this because this class ends in December, doesn't it?",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,The 17th of December. Yes.,,,SC1 11.17,
LC,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,Which is literally one month away from now.,,,SC1 11.17,
LC,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Don't worry too much about it. It's. You're worrying me.,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"Sorry. I don't want to worry you,",,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"No no no but it's completely doable. Like I or I don't know if I'm just so not worried about it but what I see here is completely doable. And we already passed the hardest. Well, one of the hardest part which is actually knowing what to do.",,,SC1 11.17,
HA,"Yeah, but LC, with you here I feel like less nervous",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,I'm gonna clap for LC.,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Thank you for being here. We love you.,,,SC1 11.17,
LC,This is so nice. Thank you guys.,,,SC1 11.17,
HA,"Yeah, I learned a lot.",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"Yeah, me too.",,,SC1 11.17,
LC,Thanks ,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,"for the what's the next phase actually like I remember this phase the first two weeks was just figuring out the question, what's the next phase? There's a PDF in the, I think main teams collaboration part, but I can't open it because of my Internet.",,,SC1 11.17,
HA,I will try. I actually will send it in the chat now.,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,Screenshot?,,,SC1 11.17,
HA,"Yeah, you hear it?",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,"Yeah, the familiar sound. Just so I know what's the next part? Because I think writing was for the last two weeks, right?",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,Oh really? So we're ahead of the game?,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Not per se. I just don't know what the what we're supposed to do for next part ,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,Understanding theoretical basis construction construction solution for the problem question right selecting and defining problem.,,,SC1 11.17,
LC,Actually I I think let next week we should be able to start like coming up with this categories of analysis. Analysis.,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,So collecting what we find through the research papers. OK whooo All right. So to feel like I did my part for this for this group like how many papers should I read what you think,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,I think we should find 7 and read 2 that's how I view it ,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,7 read two.,,,SC1 11.17,
HA,OK,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"I don't know what everybody else thinks, but that's kinda, I'm just going based off what Maria said so.",,,SC1 11.17,
HA,And the next meeting will be the same?,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,
HA,"yeah, same day, same time.",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"So our homework then is to find seven articles, read two of them thoroughly and write down in the new spreadsheet based on these six categories that we've come up with. The information in that is, am I understanding that right?",,,SC1 11.17,
HA,"Yeah. And AS, can you be the one who create the spreadsheet?",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"OK, You haven't, trust me with that sure I could do it now. Yeah, I'll do it now.",,,SC1 11.17,
HA,"Thank you. Just want to make sure because if we have a two people do the same thing, we won't be there.",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"Yeah. I know, EN, you're having a tough time with the technology, but are you OK with all of this? I don't know if you can, uh, communicate with us somehow.",,,SC1 11.17,
HA,"Yeah, just text anything. EN.",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"Well, hopefully he's OK",,,SC1 11.17,
HA,"This computer-based learning is yeah, sometimes.",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,
HA,"OK, so can I go.",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"Yeah. He's a seven article, five people. Yeah.",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"Well, we're hoping, like we're gonna extend our range from the year 2000 to the year 2020. So hopefully within that time there's been 35 articles.",,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sure we're gonna find. Yeah, plenty of articles.",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,
HA,"Yeah EN, you can read the suggestion from Maria in the WhatsApp group like here, there they have like kind of detail her suggestion what she did.",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,"So what be the goal for Module 2? For us, actually, it's like understanding theoretical basis and constructing the solution. But what? For us, that will just be the collection of all the data, right?",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,Mhm,,,SC1 11.17,
HA,Mhm,,,SC1 11.17,
LC,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,So we have…,,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"Maybe we should all, like, know what this theory, this theory that was everywhere and now I forgot how it's called Oh my gosh…",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,What theory?,,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"Theory…Oh my gosh. Come on. The the, the, the ST",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,STOG.,,,SC1 11.17,
LC,Yeah. Yeah.,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,"Theory of guidance. Yeah, I know that one.",,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"Yeah I wish you know about it like, just to be on the same page.",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"Wait, what are we talking about? What?",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,The script Theory of guidance. You remember the thing you tried to click on?,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"Yeah, yeah, Yeah.",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,And I think that's the theory part for like how external scripts help with internal scripts.,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,OK. So we should all just have an understanding of that going into the ,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,"I don't think it'll help you, but I did have like, I posted my own notes to the files. There was a little part about it, but honestly. Oh God, what's that? Oh, that's the pictures. OK, I get it. I'm sorry. But yeah, it it's probably just read up on it and yeah, it's that hard. But I think it's important. I think it's very irrelevant for what we're trying to do.",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,OK. Sounds good.,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,And then we have two weeks for that. That seems like a lot. But I know it isn't.,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"Yeah. And this FROCOLE app, it seems to be another research thing that they're doing, I'm guessing.",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Yeah. Absolutely.,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,It didn't even download on my phone. I don't know.,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Do you have a iPhone?,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,Yeah.,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Yeah. Download something else first.,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,Ah. OK. I'll read the instructions and I'll do it.,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Yeah.,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"So same time next week, everybody?",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,"Yeah. Until next week, more articles.",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,Yeah,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,So nice talking to you.,,,SC1 11.17,
AS,"Yeah. Thanks guys. It's a lot more clear now. I'm happy that it doesn't makes sense in my head. Thank you again, LC, for guiding us through this.",,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Thank you for being here.,,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"Thank you, guys.",,,SC1 11.17,
HA,Have a nice evening. Buy guys.,,,SC1 11.17,
LC,"Bye, guys.",,,SC1 11.17,
AS,Bye. Take care.,,,SC1 11.17,
AI,Alright.,,,SC1 11.24,EXT
AS,"Alright. They took a long time, but at least we know we're on the right track, like at least.",,,SC1 11.24,Q
AI,Yeah,,,SC1 11.24,Q
HA,"Yeah, do you not exactly like the day that we need to submit the article that he said like?",,,SC1 11.24,EXT
AS,17th?,,OT,SC1 11.24,Q
AI,"At the 1st of January, apparently so the 17th.",,OT,SC1 11.24,
AS,"No, but she said that yeah.",,R,SC1 11.24,ELI
AI,"17th of December. We need to be done with it, but then they'll give us some feedback and will have until the 1st of January to like use that feedback to make our final assignment border.",,R,SC1 11.24,
HA,17 of December okay.,,R,SC1 11.24,Q
AS,Yeah,,R,SC1 11.24,Q
AI,That's pretty soon.,,OT,SC1 11.24,Q
AS,I know. How many weeks is that? So we will have essentially three more meetings until then.,,OT,SC1 11.24,
HA,"Yeah, but if if you want we can have like more because they say that the minimum is one meeting per week, but it like sometimes we really need to discuss and images we we can come.",,OT,SC1 11.24,Q
AI,Yeah we can do it.,,OT,SC1 11.24,EXT
HA,So from here to 17. So all we need to do it just like continue with the article right in it.,,OT,SC1 11.24,Q
AS,"Yeah. I think today we should establish like. What exactly it is we're gonna…oh my words gone . We're gonna like what our we need to agree basically, yeah.",,OT,SC1 11.24,ELI
AI,"It helps you, we can use the like the guide that they gave us with the instructions for this. What we're supposed to do in a second module.",,OT,SC1 11.24,EXT
AS,Yeah,,OT,SC1 11.24,
AI,"Right? To see what are task exactly, it's in this next stage.",,OT,SC1 11.24,Q
AS,"Yeah , they separate it weirdly by weeks so like week 50. How do you talk about week 50",,OT,SC1 11.24,Q
AI,"Yeah, that's six weeks",,OT,SC1 11.24,EXT
AS,"So this is our third meeting, right? So we're in module two. Part one. Is that correct?",,OT,SC1 11.24,Q
AI,"We're starting with module to this week, yeah?",,OT,SC1 11.24,ELI
AS,"Yeah, so we seem like we're on the right track then because it's far as I can see.",,,SC1 11.24,Q
HA,"Yeah. So, module two, understanding theoretical basis, find more information. Hmm. And we we also have the problem and questions already right?",,P,SC1 11.24,ELI
AI,"The problem that we're defining, yeah the problem question and the aim of the context. We are currently with the articles we found so far. We got some more information and deepened our understanding of the theoretical basis, kind of.",,P,SC1 11.24,INT
HA,"Yeah, but I like as I I share in the at the beginning of the meeting. I I I do feel like I I need more a little bit more time to further readings because UM, yeah we gotta act like it is.",,P,SC1 11.24,EXT
AI,Sure yeah.,,P,SC1 11.24,Q
AS,"Yeah. It's getting harder to find them to be honest, as the numbers as we start filling them in like it's like, oh man, you also have this lens like I think HA. He actually used one of those like.",,P,SC1 11.24,EXT
AS,What's that EN?,,P,SC1 11.24,EXT
EN,"Yeah, I was. I was like I'm arguing with Roger saying this seems like what whatever you're seeing someone else has put it in there and the file and this is is almost using possible to come up with like new, independent, relevant, relevant document. now that's that. Like I'm I'm gonna be honest this is almost drove me crazy.",,P,SC1 11.24,ELI
AS,Yeah me too man ,,P,SC1 11.24,
AI,"I don't know if that's maybe good advice or not, but I usually like. I take one article that's not an empirical one, and then I find like, oh, we use this in this in this research, and then I use their references essentially as articles to cite. Maybe that could help you to find some more. By the way, LC wrote that we should finish the article search by next week and then start analyzing. I would probably agree with that.",,F,SC1 11.24,ELI
AS,"Yeah, I was thinking we could do it by this week, but are we still in time? Like if we start by next week then we just have to write the paper, right?",,P,SC1 11.24,EXT
AI,"So the paper is supposed to happen in the 5th and 6th week. So now we have two weeks to. I don't understand the basis and construct a solution for the problem, which in our case would probably be collect the data that we like want to get right so?",,P,SC1 11.24,ELI
AS,Yeah,,P,SC1 11.24,ELI
AI,"As LC says by this week, we'll try to figure out more articles, or in my case, I'll try to get like more detailed informations about the articles.",,P,SC1 11.24,Q
AS,Yeah,,P,SC1 11.24,EXT
AI,"And then next week will be like, OK, let's read all of those. Let's compare all of them. Let's find similar categories, and then we'll start with the actual writing.",,,SC1 11.24,Q
HA,Yeah.,,,SC1 11.24,Q
AS,So should we. I got two things as number one I think based on just the the the small point that LC and Maria made. Yeah let's let's do our searches with the VPN on because I think we will be able to get much more access. I don't know if anybody else didn't do that.,,,SC1 11.24,EXT
AI,"Oh, I use LC's secret site and it was amazing. Like every time was like Weinberger 35 years I was like wait maybe the other page and it worked. It was amazing. I got access all the papers.",,,SC1 11.24,Q
AS,"LC, write it down again, send up to send me that link.",,P,SC1 11.24,EXT
AI,Just write down.,,P,SC1 11.24,ELI
AS,"Yeah, and then the other thing I was gonna ask or say is UM. I mean maybe we try all to look like this CSCL scripts and scaffolding and there was collaborative scripts. I found as another keyword that was coming across in a lot of them, so maybe we can add that as a keyword as well? Oh yeah, with the quotation mark.",,P,SC1 11.24,Q
AI,"Once you look at, use exactly this way ("""")? Because then Google search will be specifically searching for these terms instead of just.",,P,SC1 11.24,Q
AS,"Oh, I see, I see. OK, my other question was should we make another like, we have the spread sheet, but should we make another file? Maybe like a Word file or something where we can do direct comparisons, because that's basically the start of the next step. No? Like seeing...",,P,SC1 11.24,EXT
AI,"Like the table analysis, right? Yeah.",,P,SC1 11.24,
AS,"Yeah, those types of things to see like these guys like it or, you know, there's some articles that say that internal scripts don't have any negative effect on learning and then it doesn't matter over scripting is not a thing right? Like so those guys disagree 'cause we're gonna have to talk about all of ours individually and then somebody's gonna have to do that work to put it together, right? So it's a little bit hard I think. I this is my opinion a little bit hard I think to look at that file like there are 35 files. You know what I mean?",,P,SC1 11.24,Q
AI,Yeah I know what you mean but I don't think another excel sheet will probably be the solution.,,P,SC1 11.24,Q
AS,(shaking his head) xxx excel sheet or something I don't know. This is my my the way my mind works.,,P,SC1 11.24,EXT
HA,"Yeah, I did create like another word file in our folder, but only for my llike individual notes because sometimes like it's hard to put it only in the square in the spreadsheet. So I I did like oh some notes separately but then I picked some key point and putting this spreadsheet. But yeah that's what I'm saying.",,P,SC1 11.24,Q
AI,"You wrote a lot. It's nice to read this. Nice to see. Yeah, I think we should maybe do a table. We should focus on the subcategories OK, LC, thank you.",,P,SC1 11.24,EXT
AS,"Yeah, I know we yeah. I agree the sub categories are the main. The main thing that we're comparing. It's just hard to read just my opinion.",,P,SC1 11.24,Q
EN,So I was gonna ask so after getting all the articles if I do five of them we then have to read all of them to like understand before we start writing.,,P,SC1 11.24,ELI
AI,"No, no, no, we don't have to like you don't have to read every single article, you just have to read seven of them or skim seven of them.",,,SC1 11.24,EXT
EN,OK OK,,,SC1 11.24,Q
HA,Yeah,,,SC1 11.24,
AI,And I'll read like 7 different ones and then we can share information like.,,,SC1 11.24,ELI
AS,"Yeah, that's that's where my question comes in. Then how are we sharing the information?",,,SC1 11.24,EXT
EN,Yeah,,,SC1 11.24,Q
AI,Yeah well with the Excel sheet hum. So…,,,SC1 11.24,EXT
HA,Yes. Hmm.,,,SC1 11.24,EXT
LC,,,,SC1 11.24,Q
AS,"Yeah, and this sub category. We need to summarize them more. I I I agree with that.",,,SC1 11.24,EXT
AI,"Oh, I did a good job that already. It's fine. Why not short? Short and sweet.",,,SC1 11.24,Q
AS,"Because at the end of this, like somebody is going to have to go look at all of the things that we've written and say, oh these guys agree these guys don't agree we have another category here. These guys use this type of technology. These guys used other technologies these guys didn't use technology so we're going to omit them. Stuff like that, right? Is that and is that a task that's going to be for one person or the way I thought in my mind was that we could all meet the next time we met or actually even this time that we met. But now next time we could do that together. So then we all have a broad understanding and then the actual writing we can split up. I don't know.",,F,SC1 11.24,ELI
AI,"Oh, I see, yeah…I don't know like I have a suspicion that the next meeting will then take like four to five hours.",,F,SC1 11.24,EXT
HA,"I think, yeah, I think the UM, away to come up with the the idea of subcategorize or like more idea for the article is that like as I'm understanding like we can continue reading by the end about by the next meeting when I'm next Wednesday, right? And then on that meeting like each of us can spend like 5 minutes or, to 7 minutes to quickly go through...",,F,SC1 11.24,ELI
AS,Yeah.,,F,SC1 11.24,Q
HA,"…what we have just found because they I feel maybe that before the meeting maybe we can, uh, we have time to look at that, but like maybe we have not had time. But like when the person explain it and we go through it together, we kind of understand the like what the authors are saying about that topic. And then after that okay, we have an overview about the like the picture, the broad picture of the research and and then we decide together, like with subcategories we want to put on the article.",,F,SC1 11.24,EXT
AS,"Yeah, I was thinking the same same thing and I don't even mind taking the notes during while other people are talking so that we can then categorize it that way and then split the work from from there.",,F,SC1 11.24,ELI
HA,"Yeah. Yeah, so I think like if I have to like kind of present. All I talked to you sharing to you so I have a son like motivation and pressure to prepare and read more carefully. So that plan. Yeah because like sometime I just like work out with my readings until the last minute and don't have time to look at your hour fighting on so so it's a good way to share it together in the meeting. And then like we come up with the subcategories then.",,F,SC1 11.24,EXT
AS,"Yeah, I'm OK with that.",,F,SC1 11.24,ELI
HA,"Yeah, I mean so I I feel more comfort table at all with with that that way and my I'm not confident with my findings right now at that moment. Like kind of try to find something, but I think I did not put like the the best effort on that because of you know.",,F,SC1 11.24,
AS,"Yeah, don't worry. I feel like I've put too much information without focusing it enough.",,F,SC1 11.24,ELI
HA,Yeah,,F,SC1 11.24,CON

AI,"Well, I think. Actually, I was thinking because I have like 2 hours two to three hours tomorrow and I thought maybe I could like read through what you wrote so far and try already to find subcategories be like. OK, this article said that scripts help. This article also said that or this one said something else just like  kind of maybe?",,F,SC1 11.24,CON
HA,"It's kind of like preliminary results. And yeah, if you buy something, just put in the teams.",,F,SC1 11.24,Q
AS,And where are you going to do that? Like are you gonna create another document or?,,P,SC1 11.24,ELI
AI,"Yeah, my first thing would be like create a word file and then be like OK. What are the main points that, like some articles had.",,P,SC1 11.24,ELI
AS,Yeah.,,P,SC1 11.24,EXT
AI," For example I remember that some of my articles my articles were like positive effect on argument construction, negative effect on motivation and over scripting pad. When you have internal scripts something like that, right?",,P,SC1 11.24,Q
HA,"Yeah, if you want we can like discuss quickly about like some sub category that you have in mind at this moment.",,P,SC1 11.24,ELI
AS,"And also if you if yeah, if you started that, I think the rest of us would just continue it. Like that's my mind goes, okay, I kinda see oh, she found these ones that are agreed. Like yeah, I don't know that sounds like a good idea to me too.",,P,SC1 11.24,ELI
AI,"Yeah, then we should also, though like give each article at least like a number or some kind of identifier so I can be like OK, this hypothesis that for example over scripting is bad, article this one, article this one, article this one you know just so we don't get lost in the information?",,P,SC1 11.24,CON
AS,Look at LC's message.,,P,SC1 11.24,Q
AI," Yes, see LC smart. She knows how to do this work.",,,SC1 11.24,ELI
HA, where would literally do that for us…the thing is that in that case we really need to be careful with the keywords…ahh,,,SC1 11.24,Q

HA," So for my part, I will try to be quick like UM. After I do this and I see some overlappings that I guess, UM yet we somehow we can do it to see that if we understand the same but like UM, in my opinion for example, this is a very interesting and, but this overlap with LC as I saw after that and also this is also overlapping, but I don't want to miss this article, because it's really, uh, it's not experimental research, but it's I feel like it's really foundation very, it’s very relevant to our topic, so I do not want to miss them.  And xxx now I will like tell like quickly about findings. So for this regulation of collaboration in project based learning mediated by CSCL scripting, reflection like they analyzed the internal script before and after a project-based learning participation. And their findings are like this. Uh, like significantly more students who encounter an unfamiliar situation already and they can like construct new regulation script and this kind of thing so the internalization. And I'm like how it happened. So I see like I don't want to like read too into detail, but I see after reading this I see some topics just like uh, suggest the condition to develop regulation script and the relation between regulation script with social challenges. For example, they said that, uh, when student face the challenges about socio-emotional challenges. They developed SRL or CO-RL script, and when they face the social cognitive challenges, they develop SSRL script, like socially-shared regulation, and this co-regulation and self-regulation. And this is also I think there's also overlap with someone internal and ",,OT,SC1 12.01,Q

I think it's just the theory with a kind of false grip components and seven principles. And and I, I think that like many of us know about this so we can read more in the link here. And the next part is that although I put here for but I won't try to summarize them in one because I found this is very interesting and research evidence on the impact of technology enhanced so it it gave me a new kind of sub categories. Is technology enhanced collaboration script. And it also gave me 4 subcategorized, which are script appropriatin, coercion on explicitness, role in scripting and role of fading or and peer monitoring techniques so they are they summarize for experimental research. Here we can see the first one is about script appropriation, so I put the findings here Uh, and the second one is about like the ads I species nest so late. Is that important? Or how to? How to you know deliver the message of explicitness in a script like you. You need to like which level of explicitness student should lightweight. And here is the detail of the research and the third one is about role like we should pay attention to how we, I think it's about the role assigned and roll division and the 4th one is about peer monitoring. So here you can see that they have three group of students, the control group they received the continuous quickly support the fading. The script let fate and after some student posts and the third is the peer monitoring group. They have a continuous script less support and additionally appear monitoring, so the fighting is student in the third group have like out performant like that, very good.

AI,Yeah.,,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"The last article I found, it's not, I mean, it’s about a man like yeah, it's about how learning space matters into how internal scripting is constructed like. It affects like, um their results like they the academic results, but they were analyzed in that true, they like internal scripting like you know theory and they also mentioned the script period guidance there so, but it doesn't explicitly say like how to get from external to internal body like has somehow something to do so I just put it there because I was desperate but I don't know if it actually works.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"That means given script theory of guidance, yeah, then that's it. That's the going from external to internal scripts, yeah?",,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"OK, then I'll leave it there. Thank you.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,And so I just had another idea.,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,Uh-huh,,,SC1 12.01,
AS,What it be categorized. The scripts based on whether they're macro or micro.,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"most of macro scripts, right?",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"OK, so it's not OK, never mind.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,It's internal xxx,,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"Yeah yeah no, no no. But we can. We can put that into the analysis like whatever 90% of the articles found are macro.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,Okay.,,,SC1 12.01,
LC,Or yeah that that can be said at some point in that discussion or analysis here.,,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"There you go, I give you xxx",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,Our whole scripts that are teached macro scripts because they're external. You can't teach it internal script. That's something in you.,,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"But that's the point though, that 'cause we can say that a lot of their macro and we we are analyzing how to which ones can let us, guide us to micro right?",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,Uhhh…,,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"Yeah, I mean…",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"I mean, I don't mind mentioning it. Yeah I get it. Yeah, that's that is something which we find, but I just find it like nonsensical. Obviously you can't teach an internal script because like.",,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"But that that's important because I mean, it's not like you're born and then you magically have an internal script.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"Yeah, you have to work, but you get that through external scripts, right?",,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"Exactly, well, yeah, exactly.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,Yep. That’s the thing.,,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"Yeah, you're right. Then. I don't know.",,,SC1 12.01,
HA,"In that video of the teacher. He mentioned in the video of the uh, we Weinberger right. He mentioned, let me see macro script. Uh, orchestration of learning arrangement, argue xxx scripts, then jigsaw.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,Yeah.,,,SC1 12.01,
HA,"So script schema, peer review script",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"Script yeah, those are good. That's the thing I also read about peer reviewed. If something is peer review, you know having that as part of the conversation? Yeah, please continue HA.",,,SC1 12.01,
HA,"And what else and then, uh, internal and external script  I just did read again that that that lecture.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,Yep.,,,SC1 12.01,
HA,Yeah.,,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"Actually, in the in the Article 2 because they they go over 4 studies and Baker in London horn et al. the learning protocol approach. Uh, Camille approach. These are all approaches towards scripting as well.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,That they are.,,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"Yeah, so I don't know if they have names, 'cause I guess we can look at those articles to see if they have names. Like which type of script they're discussing, right?",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"You know what they say they say, and those are collaboration scripts.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,Identifying covers everything in the cloud relations correct exactly.,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"Yeah, that's the problem, it's insane.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,But I guess we should maybe ask Maria that question like what like we need to define collaboration script. I think I did in the thing that I gave the paper outline. Did I know I didn't?,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"You have collaboration script, I think written there but not defined.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,Hmm,,,SC1 12.01,
HA,"I think the macro and micro is not the same it doesn’t have the same meaning with internal and external. Macro script arranged learning activity by grouping and regrouping learners, distributing resources and asset prices and micro script support collaborative learning by specifying and distributing role.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"You're right, yeah, don't something.",,,SC1 12.01,
HA,And then xxx,,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"So then could we use them as categories of separation, further discussion?",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,I think we can put the scripts into those categories and micro and macro.,,,SC1 12.01,
LC,What do you mean?,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"I mean micro scripts are like just like structuring the communication interface so they are very like they don't do a lot, you know.",,,SC1 12.01,
LC,Yeah,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,They just do the basics with macro. Micro script do a lot in terms of also like sequencing and giving you phases and distributing roles I think.,,,SC1 12.01,
LC,Yeah.,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"So maybe we find like argumentative scripts and they are at the same time microscript because they don't do like you know, they work on a lower level. But or they might be macro scripts because they work like they do a lot, you know.",,,SC1 12.01,
LC,Yeah.,,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"We're getting more and more complex without question, though I think right.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"It means we're learning, I guess.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,Yes,,,SC1 12.01,
LC,Yeah,,,SC1 12.01,
HA,"Yeah, I think.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"So just to be clear, I think the roadblock that we're hitting now is that our second question. We cannot find enough research about those types of scripts is that the is that the road block?",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,I think it's more that we don't want to do the analysis.,,,SC1 12.01,
HA,"You know, in terms of the types of scripts kind of in order to categorize them. One question will be like based on what criteria and it kind of it could like lead to who many questions about like how logically we do that based on which criteria are they like equal in late at the overlapping or things like that?",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,Yeah that’s true.,,,SC1 12.01,
HA,Is that…yeah…,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,That is something means to consider. I think what we probably need to do right now is just start actually reading the articles that we read ourselves and try to figure out what kind of scripts that was like instead of saying collaborations scripting be like OK but what exactly did they do? So we can maybe like? Not come back to this next week because next week we need to start writing but…,,,SC1 12.01,
HA,Yeah.,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"…figure out like OK, so these are the different types of scripts that we could potentially find here.",,,SC1 12.01,
HA,"And I think like we need to think carefully about the subcategories that we want to do, for example, like a niche like bring out the idea that should we go like with the subcategories of types of script. But like yeah it is. Yeah, we need to like agree on that is that layer and kind of appropriate way to go with? Is there any like consequence or like difficulties or we can, uh I don't. Yeah now I'm just a little bit confused about this sub categories in there like.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"If their full careful big enough to be sub categories, right, yeah.",,,SC1 12.01,
HA,"You know, because they if we decide now we decide their sub categories, like that types and so we feel like we need to read more and we need to find more research about their types of scripts out there, because our uhm, our findings is like not enough in terms of types of script, but we have a lot more things. So yeah, it's kind of.",,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"Yeah, well. You’re right, I agree with you like we should like that's what we found we should. See what where we can get from, like right now with what we have.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"Yeah, well, I think we can stick with it because like right now I just did a Google Scholar search of adaptive scripts and I got a few articles. So like it's there. So I think we should stick with the ones that we already have and as AI was saying, scam the current articles that we already looked at to see if there's more keys scripts, types of scripts? Then it? Wouldn't that be OK? Because it's not like we have the main article that for example talks about adaptive scripts and then now we just need to find a few more that support it. I don't know is that correct or incorrect?",,,SC1 12.01,
HA,Umm.,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"I think it's mostly correct, yeah. I think that's what we need to do. Just reread what we found, see how they defined the scripts, what kind they used. Then maybe I don't know I don't know, maybe we need to meet up on like the weekend which kind of sucks, but maybe you'll have to do it just to agree on like the final types that we will go with. So say OK, I found that they use like this. One was for argumentation, yada yada. Then our job is to literally just be like OK. Argumentative scripts whether we find most are done with this type of technology and with these many amounts of students and they show these in these results. Then just get all the results together.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"Yeah, and then from there we say OK well this is a good or a bad way to go from…",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,External to internal?,,,SC1 12.01,
AS,Thank you yeah. Right?,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"I'd say so, yeah, probably it's just. It's just work to do.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"Yeah, but it's focused work so.",,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"Yeah, sort of.",,,SC1 12.01,
HA,"For my life and my my readings does the thing that I read and my findings. I feel like they are more on the relation between scripts and other conditions in learning. For example, like the one article is about the relation between scripts with the social challenges.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,Uh-huh,,,SC1 12.01,
HA,"And with what else? With UM, task perception with the role that division with the peer monitoring…",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,That one,,,SC1 12.01,
LC,I saw a lot about that peer monitoring. We should talk about it.,,,SC1 12.01,
HA,Yeah,,,SC1 12.01,
AS,So are you proposing HA to change the category is not from scripts but to learner roles.,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"Not learning rules, I think she means that it her in the studies. They didn't just go for hey, do we use this script? But they also go for like different things at the same time. So maybe here we used the script and then here we also kind of did more like role-based stuff and you know.",,,SC1 12.01,
HA,"Yeah, I think like the resource that I read, they did not, you know like try to use up some specific type of script and like see the difference between the different types of scripts, but I feel like in the different article that I read they try to put some kind of collaboration script in like different condition to see the relation between the xxx with you know like put it in how well I put it in a group with like the social challenges and the role if you like change the way the roal division, what happened and also.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"I have a question. Uh, with the role division, for example, did they use the script to divide the roles or with the script not relevant to the role division?",,,SC1 12.01,
HA,"Let me read it again. You know, like some article I just scanning scheme.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"Yeah, yeah.",,,SC1 12.01,
HA,"Uh, let me see…",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"While you're scanning anyways, I think HA might be onto something here because we could refine that second question, research questions then to see how do collaborative scripts affect like you, but I don't know how to, I don't know how to define that second part. Like seeing the roles, HA xxx lists those things again like we need to categorize all of those things together. Then we can have a comparison between them to see bun then we lose the external internal part, don't we? In that, whatever, I'm so confused.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"You know what I mean though, right? Like if we change it then we lose, yeah.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,The thing that I wonder.,,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"Yeah, but like we could like the first part of the question, how was it?",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,How do collaborative scripts affect? Or have an effect on?,,,SC1 12.01,
LC,The internalization of scripts.,,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"OK, so let's let's write this down you guys. OK, I'm gonna open up the CSCL thing. I'm gonna write it underneath as #3 just so because. So because we don't lose the old ones. OK, but we can actually cut them. So was it how does? How do collaboration scripts?",,,SC1 12.01,
LC,Yeah,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"Affect internalization, but isn't that the very first question that we had before?",,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"Yeah, actually it is, but wait.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,It's more specific. We didn't talk about collaborative scripts. We just set the scripts in general. Now we're focusing on,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"You know that most scripts are collaborative, right?",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,Think about it just means and before that question we will just have to define collaborative scripts.,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,OK,,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"No, but first in like in the beginning we ended up changing the question and this should be. I think this third one, which was the first one in the beginning, should be the one we should be focusing on.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,So how do we say it's a harder collaboration scripts affect?,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,Internalization.,,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"Uh, internalization.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"Of different aspects, maybe knowledge retention or I don't know.",,,SC1 12.01,
HA,"Yeah. Uh, you know like I remember the in the previous meetings like we, we decided that we will read based on the research question of like internalization and we will find the article about their relation between internal and external script and how they like transform from external to internal so. Why we not like stick with that question and then we just analyze what we read. For example, maybe it could be a little bit less messy at the beginning, for example, because I I read based on that question. So for example, like in this article and they examined, in that in that condition in that article, the internal script is that looked like this and...",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"Yeah, see, I was thinking the same thing, but then I thought the problem in that came in that that is our interpretation, whereas this critical review has to be based on empirical information you didn't mean.",,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"No, but it doesn't have to be only your opinion. Like if we see like in in certain a paper we see that it is or it is not working, or like they're describing things there. So, I think I'm with you HA. We should like actually I should stop searching because I won't find more things and actually take one of your papers because I found that the the papers you found and help you literally read and analyze instead of keep looking for information and just be super clear like what things we should be focusing on, like which type of script it is? what are the results they got, which tools like which like a you know tools or like, uh, accommodations of the groups they use or whatever. And this point, that out so we can say, the 30% use this 40% use that and blah blah.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"Yeah, just keep the questions the same and just like analyze it, AI you want to say something you put your hand up ",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,Yeah,,,SC1 12.01,
HA,"So like, do you mean that like we, uh, keep their previous question of like internalization and then we just analyze like what we found the article or? And then we just, by analyzing in terms of the method they use the reason they found, and so on?",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"If I can. Give my two cents. The thing is, you remember how Maria said that I was too much for the first question because it's not precise enough. I agree that we should just use what we found, but maybe we can find a way to like, I think, by dividing the different scripts into types. That would be like kind of more specific and not general, so you know.",,,SC1 12.01,
HA,Yeah,,,SC1 12.01,
AS,Keep it the same like diskeeper we have. Yeah I kind of agree with that AI here.,,,SC1 12.01,
HA,Yeah,,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"I think I actually I don't mind looking for more articles personally, just on those different types of scripts that we've already laid out.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"See that I wouldn't stay do that. I would just use what we have already found, you know.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,Oh,,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"Yeah, because because then we will start looking for more and will realize it more interesting stuff and we'll keep on looking. But then there is. The thing is that like we, we didn't have that much time.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"Yeah. OK, so then maybe then, instead of doing that, then I'll go with LC's idea as well. I'm reading these articles and just finding where they go from in external to internal and if they do like that's that's the best way to move forward then.",,,SC1 12.01,
LC,I guess.,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"Depends. Yeah, depends on do you want to stick with the type thing or do you want to go more general again? Because if you go for the type thing, that type of collaboration scripts, that's something that you should focus on instead while you read.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,Hmm,,,SC1 12.01,
HA,My opinion is that both two ways they have pros and cons…,,,SC1 12.01,
HA,"…but my problem is that uh, in the article that I read, I cannot find much about like types of script we can see even when you mentioned here the regulations script or technology enhance. But actually because I, I read it so I remember that like they did not mention it as a type of, they just they mentioned about the regulation of script and they should stay and you know, like…",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"So yeah. So then so then, AI go ahead.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"Yeah, maybe like maybe you can find out through reading what kind of script they used, like what they did with the script, like what the script was supposed to do if it was supposed to give the participants for example rolls or if it was supposed to guide them what they had to do, we can divide them like that or we can say that some studies didn't define the type of script that they used, you know.",,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"Yeah, that's actually a valid conclusion as well.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,Yes,,,SC1 12.01,
HA,Yeah so.,,,SC1 12.01,
AS,That sounds xxx right? But in in that in that scenario then would we have another category as undefined or would we just choose where we put it?,,,SC1 12.01,
HA,Hmm so.,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"We have to read first, so to figure out. Like you know what this type of script seems like. It's for the purposes of guiding the students in this way that way, and if they don't specify it, we just say…",,,SC1 12.01,
HA,I think I think now I get what you mean. Like we stay with those article and just like we focus on find out what type of that script.,,,SC1 12.01,
AS,Mhm,,,SC1 12.01,
HA,Answer that question. Right?,,,SC1 12.01,
AS,Yeah,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,Exactly.,,,SC1 12.01,
HA,"Yeah, because I, I just think that like I don't have that much uh many findings about ties, and then I need to read more more, but I guess, yeah, I guess I I get what you mean now.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"Yeah, I mean and then we're all doing that individually for our articles and I guess. Or, you know, LC. You can lead ours too ",,,SC1 12.01,
LC, what xxx,,,SC1 12.01,
AS,And then we.,,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"I can, I mean, because I know it's a hard like thing to do, so you can give me like each one of you can give me few or one. Not a few, but maybe one or something like that so I can like reduce your lot of work.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"And then we write that down in the discussions and limitations part, correct?",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"That's a good idea. We are not discussions, emanations, analysis. We write that down under analysis. Like if you find, right, exactly like you write down what your article found in ideally short sentences that describe, hey, this article found that. We had a role dividing or role giving out script and defects where again on the domain knowledge low or good for argumentation.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,Uh-huh,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,Something like that.,,,SC1 12.01,
LC,Yeah,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,So we get the analysis may be done by next week because we really need to like get it done.,,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"OK, now I I think I think the big question mark was with these sub categories makes sense and now that we know we can have an undefined category or place the place them in what we glean from the articles themselves that that solved that question and we can just kind of move forward with what we have, right?",,,SC1 12.01,
LC,Yeah,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,I think so too.,,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"Yeah, cool. Uhm so when do we meet again this weekend?",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"Yeah, that's the question. We maybe we don't have to meet, but we can like write down hey, the articles that I found. I would describe them like these kind of scripts. What did you find? We would have to need to do meeting, I think actually.",,,SC1 12.01,
HA,"So it's just like, uh, now go to the article that we read and write down like which type of script they use there, and do we need to rely on so the effectiveness of that in terms of internalization? So like two kind of tool point in our writing for it each? ",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,Yeah,,,SC1 12.01,
HA,Yeah yeah yeah.,,,SC1 12.01,
AS,And and I think that also the study right? Like which which study they they used?,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"yeah, we should probably just instead of writing the whole name of the study umm, right down like the number on the side right? Like for example study number on the side. For example, study number…",,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"Or starts citing. So let's let's just start citing like if we were like that's part of the thing that we wAI right? So you know last name and the year of the people like they I forgot how to say that, but you got it I guess.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,The promise I will when we sometimes have the similar names and a similar year that might be confusing.,,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"Ah, I see. Uhm? OK, then put it all in a little side number because that's a really good idea, but just to you know to get that done.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,Yeah xxx (pointing),,,SC1 12.01,
HA,"Yeah, so now will put the number for the article and then in our writing and we write that but when we polished the file we will put it the right form. Apply citation in text citation, right?",,,SC1 12.01,
LC,Yeah,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"Ideally you could do it right now as well, and I think the analysis part. We will write that on the word file or you know?",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"Yeah, I think the word file. I'm actually making a note here TypeScript discussed effectiveness is skipped transition from external to internal?",,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"Yeah or internalization. Oh yeah, yeah.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,Yeah internal and then citation. But how we doing it and which article? So year. What did we say year?,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"They said, just xxx",,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"Not just the last name and the year like you just do, you know?",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"OK, so.",,,SC1 12.01,
LC,And can you can you guys on your excel on the Excel sheet just like I don't know somehow point out the reading. You don't want to do so I can do it like.,,,SC1 12.01,
AS,Yeah,,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"You can just give me what I learned. The longest ones I don't care. But like yeah, just?",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,I guess.,,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"EN said please, man said please, someone should post our resolutions here having some oh oh EN, if you go into the can you hear us? I'll type to him. If you go into teams we have uploaded the the a Word document with all the things we have and what we need to do. Our focus right now will be in the analysis part right? Will be in the analysis part analysis now part where we should. Uh, reread our articles to follow and breakdown the bracketed information right? Nobody? Okay, just get a go.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,I'm sorry I wasn't.,,,SC1 12.01,
LC,Oh but yeah.,,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"OK, it's like I think I got it.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"Uh, we read our articles and figure out the type of script.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"Yeah, that's what I yeah. I wrote it in brackets, but we should yeah.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"Ok good. My dude, I've been having headaches for the last like 6 hours. This is awful.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"Yeah, these days are rough, but what about the discussion part? Are we doing anything for that or are we leaving that for later?",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"Yeah, later I think.",,,SC1 12.01,
LC,we can leave that for later. Let let let's focus on. So let's focus on doing this.,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,Because we need to analyze everything first before we can come to conclusion I need. You probably have a conclusion already ,,,SC1 12.01,
AS, But I have to go top down like I I have to do the introduction for it. 'cause I I my brain will not work unless it goes like this.,,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"Like I get it, I get it right.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"Let's let's cool if you have time to do that. Sure, I mean yeah.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"Yeah, I just write really fast as well which is also another thing. Again, if you guys don't mind like I can make it pretty at the end, 'cause why?",,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"Oh my gosh, I used to be the one with making pretty early documents in the end. But yeah I can. I can give you the owner.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"Yeah, what I'm honestly LC. If it was making your pretty on PowerPoint or anything like that like yeah, if it's making pretty just with words. I can do that, but nothing else..",,,SC1 12.01,
LC,"Yeah yeah do it. I mean, I think you're you're but way better writing in English than I am. So yeah, go ahead.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"That's a good aspect. Yeah, I didn't think of them.",,,SC1 12.01,
HA,"All right, don't get like depressed when reading my writing. ",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,Ohh jesus  Please stop it. ,,,SC1 12.01,
HA,"Yeah, you should prepare a good health and do some do some meditation before.",,,SC1 12.01,

HA,"As as I'm writing in the file, so I write here like each one writes his or her analysis including witch type of script was using the experimental research and what are the effects of that types of internalization of script, right?

HA,"Yes, so we meet for what? like at that?",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,In the same time Sunday?,,,SC1 12.01,
HA,At that time we are writing it and then we meet to discuss?,,,SC1 12.01,
AS,"Yeah, then it took collaborative to mesh it together. Is that? Yeah, I think that has to happen.",,,SC1 12.01,

LC,"Yeah, I think the same. It's gonna be like oh, really.",,,SC1 12.01,

AS,"Yeah I wAI see if you give it to me at 9:00 AM like I will do that work and I will like you know to mean like if we don't finish I can finish for us. And I will consider those two, my parts, the introduction in that part. Then of course I'll do more, but.",,,SC1 12.01,
LC,OK,,,SC1 12.01,
HA,"Yeah, but like I I cannot meet on Tuesday because I have a lectur in the morning and then like this uh eight to 10 in the morning and then 12:00 to 4:00 in the afternoon. So I only have two hours for xxx things like that.",,,SC1 12.01,

LC,"Then maybe. But I'm sorry, sorry.",,,SC1 12.01,
HA,"Yeah, is that OK? I just tried to complete my writing a before the meeting and then. Uh, maybe you can do some at at my if there are any important note, just tag me after mentioning and chat texting the test line. I can do it before the meeting with Maria.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"We can also ask a EN when he asked time, because maybe if he he'll have time in the afternoon then you could meet just without me instead. You know just to get the most amount of people in the group.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,Yeah I messaged him. I said does 9:00 AM silent time work for you so.,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"I see, yeah.",,,SC1 12.01,
AS,Let's wait for his answer.,,,SC1 12.01,
HA,So our plan will be they try to complete writing kind of writing our product before Tuesday and then meet each other on Tuesday and then polish it and then Wednesday we meet for Maria and for discussion.,,,SC1 12.01,
AS,Uh-huh,,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"Yeah, I think that's due.",,,SC1 12.01,
LC,Yes.,,,SC1 12.01,

LC,"Yeah yeah, yeah.",,,SC1 12.01,
HA,OK,,,SC1 12.01,
LC,Yeah.,,,SC1 12.01,

LC,"Yeah, I just highlighted or something whatever so I can if I I know and I can.",,,SC1 12.01,
AI,"Do you have a preference? Like honestly, you can just choose one. I would not be mad. Maybe go for one where I don't have many notes because I probably you know, didn't feel as excited. The final one was too easy. I know that. That was like not much information. Yeah, maybe maybe the 2nd to last one. I don't have any notes on that. Maybe you know.",,,SC1 12.01,

LC,Yeah,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"Yeah. That's what I was thinking too. Like like if if the if the research that we read says oh, the students had a positive outlook after doing the, going through the research experiment, then we can say yes we can surmise from this that this this script has a positive way of going from external to internal, right. Is that is that correct? That's the only one I'm unsure about.",,,SC1 12.07,Q

EN,"You said for the third question, ""how suitable are the specific scripts for going from external to internal"". Like what particular script are we referring to there?",,,SC1 12.07,Q
AS,"Well, that's what we were talking about last meeting when we were doing the analysis. So it goes back to, it goes back to question, research question one, right.
We're gonna group together these types of scripts.
We haven't done that yet.
Once we're finished grouping them, then those are the types of scripts that we're gonna be talking about.",,,SC1 12.07,EXT
LC,"Well, I have a question there. I don't know if if it's too much like we're trying to.
Categorize?",,,SC1 12.07,ELI
AS,Yeah.,,,SC1 12.07,Q
LC,"And then, Oh no. OK, no. And then we wAI see which category was. But no, no, I'm sorry, never mind.",,,SC1 12.07,Q
AS,Haha it’s good. ,,,SC1 12.07,
EN,"So if if I'm, if I'm getting what LC is saying, like pretty much we categorize and then we'll find which category is, uh, more suitable for going from external to links internal. OK.",,R,SC1 12.07,CON
AS,Yeah.,,,SC1 12.07,EXT
HA,"And I just have a feeling that like these questions are too much. Because you know like yesterday I read through many articles and then I feel like they answer some questions like for example the most popular question is the effectiveness of that kind of script in collaboration in CSCL.
So if in an article that we solve three problem, 1st we try to categorize is a lot of work already and then we analyze it based on the xxx and then three we like evaluate it in terms of effectiveness. So I just feel it is a lot of work. After my readings I feel like it is a good way to 1st. like we try to gather on the types of the scripts and categorize them and then we analyze their effectiveness. I feel the issue of going from external to internal scripts is like another way of saying the effectiveness because a successful script, an effective script is a script that support internal script. Yeah. So like when I read the articles, I feel like sometimes they don't mention directly that it going from external to internal, but they just mentioned the effectiveness, the benefits. So it's also about like internalization.
",,,SC1 12.07,Q
AS,"So yeah, that's the point though, isn't it?
Because that's the analysis that we are creating.
That's what kind of makes our paper what it is like we're looking at these people.
Because I feel if we just said effectiveness, then there'll be like effectiveness of what?",,,SC1 12.07,Q
LC,Yeah,,,SC1 12.07,ELI
HA,"Mhm. If I tell me this, maybe too general, too strong.",,,SC1 12.07,Q
AS,"Yeah. Because HA, what you're saying that I think what you're saying is the same, is literally the same thing. But we, if we specified, I think it'll save our butts, basically. If we were to cut one, I don't know how we would cut one. I think research question number one is just more of a framing question so that we really only have the two, which is how do these scripts follow us. Like #2 is the one that would be easiest to cut if we were to cut one. But number two really does guide because this the scripting theory of guidance is all about going from external to internal like that is the one of the main ideas of it. So I I honestly don't think it's gonna be that difficult. I don't know if anybody else agrees with me or not.",,,SC1 12.07,Q
HA,I think that maybe I will try to… ,,,SC1 12.07,Q

I'm just thinking maybe maybe we don't have to add, should I say overloads now probably just on just stay on course. I don't know. I don't know, considering the the time we have…",,F,SC1 12.07,ELI

LC,"It's not difficult. It's not difficult like that can be done. But that takes time. And I think it's time that we don't have because yeah, this should be ready in like what, 10 days?",,F,SC1 12.07,EXT
AI,"If you want me to check. Yeah, I think it should be done by.",,F,SC1 12.07,ELI

So maybe we should what if we do this like not to to cut the second question completely, but just to analyze the like the the scripts we've we have with the with the different articles only in light of transactivity principle or and maybe internal script in induction principle ",,F,SC1 12.07,Q

So in the collaborative argument script, the external script becomes more permissive to longer dyads, the longer interactive by giving, there's increasing more degrees of freedom. They have provided the opportunity to improve internal scripts guide their argumentation in their less restrictive. So the answer for question three is yes for this one, right? So here we're talking about the external script becomes more permissive by giving increased freedom and the opportunity to improve internal scripts.

First, based on the collaborative activity, second, they based on how much structure of the script is and the third criteria is the extent to which they are accompanied with additional content related support.

Mostly the most script types were like helping to write arguments, and the basic is like, that's good for argumentative knowledge building, but it's bad for the main knowledge building. That's the baseline. Usuallty. That's what you find, so you can't say that scripting is better. So they usually find that OK.

AI,"Ummm internalization it depends on. I mean, they just like gave the students different roles. Like for example, someone had the role of a summarizer, so they were in a group and then the summarizer person at the end had to be like, OK, this is the end of our session, this is what we found out And then this group performed better at the end because they had different roles.",,,SC1 12.07,EXT
AS,Did they ever switch?,,,SC1 12.07,Q
AI,I don't know how much that’s like internalization of a script.,,,SC1 12.07,Q
AS,Did they switch roles though?,,,SC1 12.07,Q
LC,"No, they they shouldn't have. Because when was the experimental group and the others are controlled.",,,SC1 12.07,Q
AS,"No I mean, like, did they switch like one person was had this job, the other person had this job, the other person had this job. Did they switch within their group?",,,SC1 12.07,EXT
AI,"I think, yeah.",,,SC1 12.07,Q
AS,"Yeah. I think we can make an argument for internalization then because they're seeing their other group mates act and then they know how to act in the other in the other role. Is that a, is that an argument?",,,SC1 12.07,Q
AI,That's true.,,,SC1 12.07,Q

AS,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can hear that.",,,SC1 12.07,EXT
AI,Good,,,SC1 12.07,Q
LC,"Wait, so, so wait, wait. I have a question here. So should we shouldn't we just specify some categories of analysis within this this thing that we're doing here? Like how did it work regarding main specific knowledge? You know, like or how did it work regarding this and that? Do you get it?",,,SC1 12.07,EXT
AI,Yeah. What are we focusing on? What are we trying to internalize here?,,,SC1 12.07,ELI
LC,Yeah,,,SC1 12.07,EXT
AS,"When you say internalize, are you, do you mean internal scripts or internalize with like ourselves?",,,SC1 12.07,ELI

AS,"Well, that's, I was just trying to find that like in what you were saying, because ",,,SC1 12.07,EXT
AI,"I think we need to figure that out because in my example, I really don't know if if we're talking about like domain specific knowledge and internalizing that, then role assigning scripts are great but if we're talking about argumentative knowledge, then the argumentative script is better. It depends on what we're trying to internalize.",,,SC1 12.07,Q
LC,"Wait, can you repeat what you said?",,,SC1 12.07,ELI
AI,cutting out.,,,SC1 12.07,Q
HA,Yeah. So.,,,SC1 12.07,ELI
LC,"Oh wait, AI, can you repeat what you just said? Because that that's that's gonna be like, that's important.",,,SC1 12.07,Q
AI,"Would I just set the domain specific knowledge or the argumentative based knowledge Like depending on which one we're trying to internalize, we have to focus on another script?",,,SC1 12.07,Q
HA,"Yeah, basically we have two type of knowledge, general domain knowledge and specific domain knowledge. So the specific domain knowledge is the I I have the definition of the of them in my document. So the domain, a specific domain knowledge is like very specific knowledge. For example, when you learn math and literature or science, is the like the knowledge about that subject and like the specific but general domain knowledge is not related directly to that subject or the thing that we want to take student, but they earn something else for example, collaboration skill, argumentation skill, negotiation skills. Yeah As for my understanding it's like that. So they said that script collaboration script sometime like in many article they found out that script did not supports the domain a specific domain knowledge for example that collaboration script don't make you like have a higher grade at math at the exam but it's support very strongly the skill, the argumentation skill, the negotiation skill. So in a long term it's better.",,,SC1 12.07,Q
AS,"It's kind of, yeah so that's how I understood it too. And for me that general domain knowledge is similar to or almost the same as an internal script.",,,SC1 12.07,EXT
AI,Mhm,,,SC1 12.07,Q
HA,I think so.,,,SC1 12.07,Q
AS,"That's the yeah, which is, which is why I was saying for this one, the first one that AI said it has positive effects on argumentation and knowledge. To me that sounds like it's positive for internal scripting because even though this, yeah, even though the students don't do well in this test, they have this idea now that they can use in other in other scenarios.",,,SC1 12.07,ELI
HA,Yeah.,,,SC1 12.07,ELI
AI,Mhm. So in that way we would say that the argumentative script is better for internalization and the role assigning script is not that good for that for general domain knowledge.,,,SC1 12.07,EXT
AS,Yeah,,,SC1 12.07,ELI
HA,Yeah,,,SC1 12.07,EXT

LC,oh or or whatsapp voice note,,,SC1 12.07,ELI
AI,Oh whatsapp voice note Yeah ,,,SC1 12.07,CON
AS,"yeah OK we'll wait for him to do that then. So then the second one here role assigning script. One group has scripts and they perform better with domain specific knowledge. Do we think this is good or bad, AI? For the internal scripts?",,,SC1 12.07,INT
AI,Should we listen to the message first?,,,SC1 12.07,Q

AS,"That's right, ",,,SC1 12.07,INT
AI,"I really don't know, because that's all the articles said, just that they performed better at the end, you know, for the final result. But I don't know if they then became like, you know, better knowledge seekers afterwards. I think this was mostly for that one specific, ",,,SC1 12.07,INT
AS,"but that's how, when they were in their small groups, did they only have one role or did they switch between roles as they were performing, as they were doing their activity?",,,SC1 12.07,ELI
AI,"See, don't. I thought while I was reading it said that they switched the roles, which makes sense to me as well.",,,SC1 12.07,EXT
AS,Yeah.,,,SC1 12.07,ELI
AI,"But at the end that kind of implied that they that there was only one person and the person, does the person in that one role perform better overall, Which kind of implies that there was usually only one, you know, like that they didn't switch.",,,SC1 12.07,CON
LC,Yeah,,,SC1 12.07,EXT
AS,"well, maybe you can just look at it again and I'll work on if they switch roles, then yes, then good for internal scripts because they learn from each other. If not, then we gotta figure something out.",,,SC1 12.07,Q
LC,"Well, if not that, that can be also a conclusion. Like it's not and it's not a specified what exactly is that good for?",,,SC1 12.07,EXT
AS,"Oh OK, it it is unspecified if they internalized anything, right?",,,SC1 12.07,ELI
LC,Yeah,,,SC1 12.07,Q
AS,internalize anything because everything was because all scripts remained external.,,,SC1 12.07,ELI
AI,"One thing I can tell you though, is that there was someone with the role of like making conversation and argumentation happen. So they did participate like kind of more in the collaboration process, which would be some like kind of internalization.",,,SC1 12.07,EXT
AS,Say it again? One person what?,,,SC1 12.07,EXT
AI,"One person had the role of like have having the argument going, you know, so they collaborated better. I don't exactly remember what his job was, what he exactly did, but you know, he like was like, OK, what's your exact argument? What's your counter argument? How do you like…",,,SC1 12.07,Q
AS,"See then that would be an argument for external scripts because you have somebody outside. It's it's like the guide or the teacher and then, no?",,,SC1 12.07,Q
AI,"I mean, yeah, it would be just a student with the role of someone giving an external script, I guess. Yeah.",,,SC1 12.07,EXT
AS,"So yeah, that's that'll that'll go into the. If not, then if not, it is unspecified if the internal is anything, because all scripts remain external, especially with the guiding student, right. Something like that.",,,SC1 12.07,Q

LC,"Because it gives the idea of, like, it's super quick Like, what's this about? and what were our results?",,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"Yeah. OK. OK, that's cool. And then so this is due in how many days? 11 days? Is that they said?",,,SC1 12.07,
LC,Yeah,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"OK then, Yeah. I don't know. So, LC, are you OK with the, the methods part?",,,SC1 12.07,
LC,"Yeah, I'm on. I mean, it's not that long. I'm almost done with this. I'm, I'm, I mean I'm gonna keep writing about like I'll describe these meetings and I'll describe this process and if you want and if you if you see something else that's not there or that should be changed, you can tell me. But like the the thing that's left here to do is basically describe these meetings, this and then say that we came up with the solution, which was the little table that we're putting down there. And how do you mean by this?",,,SC1 12.07,
AS,What?,,,SC1 12.07,
LC,What do you mean with this? How did we keep the articles?,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"That's that's what Maria had said. So we should like we only read the, like we read eight articles fully and then the other ones we only read the abstract and the conclusion, things like that. I think maybe to help LC out, we can actually just make little notes and say how each of us did it and she can write it in. Is that good for you, LC?",,,SC1 12.07,
LC,Yeah like if you want you can like right here how how did you do it. Although yeah I think it's gonna be the same for us like we all need to like I I have to come up with a single thing to to yeah process ,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"just just write it then and then yeah and then yeah. But what about the other parts then analysis and results we're doing together scenes and then what's after that? And then discussion and limitations, recommendations for future research and conclusions. Does anybody wAI take charge in any one of those spots?",,,SC1 12.07,
LC,"Yeah, I can do the word discussions and limitations, Recommendations for feeder research or conclusions. It's fine for me. Or discussions and limitations because you have the most of the articles.
So…",,,SC1 12.07,
AI,Hmm,,,SC1 12.07,
LC,"…I think you can just keep doing that and then when that's done, I can do the the other part. If if we did, ",,,SC1 12.07,
HA,"Yeah, either future like something that, like we can suggest for the future is a systematic way to categorize.",,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"Yeah, yeah. But do you guys wAI do all of these in pieces or do you want us, should we assign one per group member?",,,SC1 12.07,
AI,"It's just that they're not all equally, you know, like the introduction and explaining the whole topic, that's gonna be a big chunker.",,,SC1 12.07,
AS,Yeah,,,SC1 12.07,
LC,Yeah,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"yeah, that's true.",,,SC1 12.07,
AI,You get what I mean? Do you hear me?,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can you hear us?",,,SC1 12.07,
AI,(fist pump) Thank you. You know what? Today's not my meeting.,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,Can you hear us?,,,SC1 12.07,
AI,"Yeah. Sometimes it's fine for like 5 minutes. And then it's like, yeah, today not.",,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"Well, what you're saying is that it's the categories are…",,,SC1 12.07,
AI,"like for example, right now I see you moving and I think you're talking, but",,,SC1 12.07,
LC,"OK, that's crazy.",,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"I'm talking now.  But you're saying you're saying that the categories are unequal, right? Like in terms of workload. Ah, she can't hear us. What are you, LC, HA and EN? What do you guys think? Like how should we distribute the work 'cause we gotta get it done soon.",,,SC1 12.07,
LC,"Yeah, like you. I mean what I think is I did my article and I don't have any others, like I have another one which is the the other. I mean I I just only I have two. So that's it. I'll be done and I wAI look for the articles and then I'll wait until you do the other articles and get the results and like show me the results so I can write, for example, the discussion or like the the concussions or I don't know.",,,SC1 12.07,
AS,OK,,,SC1 12.07,
LC,Or both,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,Yeah,,,SC1 12.07,
EN,Sorry. Should you still be looking for article by this time? I don't know. Probably you're now up to seven. But I don't know. Would you still be Maybe you should channel that energy into something else I think.,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"Oh, sorry, EN. You you cut out there too, my friend.",,,SC1 12.07,
LC,"No, no, no. But I got it. I got him. I I think I got you Emanual. Yeah. We shouldn't be looking for more articles at this point. That that what we got is what we got. And that's it.",,,SC1 12.07,
AI,Yay. Nice.,,,SC1 12.07,
LC,"Yeah, that. Like, if we are gonna look for any other sort of reference to to whatever, to to write anything else, that's another thing. But no more articles to analysis. That's why I'm saying, like, I won't look for anything else. I'll just wait for you to write it results. So I can start writing with the results. I can start writing the the discussion.",,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"So who wants to do that part then? Like I'm gonna stick with the introduction I if nobody wants to do to to to to compile the analysis, I will do it. But does 'cause that is also a task. So I think that should be you know specified to one person or maybe two people to do that.",,,SC1 12.07,
LC,OK xxx  ,,,SC1 12.07,
AI,xxx attempt if you help me ,,,SC1 12.07,
EN,I’ll do all parts. Sorry xxx,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,Umm am I still sharing my screen?,,,SC1 12.07,
AI,Yeah.,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"OK. So for this part, the, the analysis and the results, right.
Like we each have to. Sorry. This part, we each have to give our own analysis from the articles that we read. But somebody has to put it all together.",,,SC1 12.07,
AI,Mhm,,,SC1 12.07,
LC,"OK, Well, then. OK, No, this is better. I could do that.",,,SC1 12.07,
AI,"No, LC, you're doing too much.",,,SC1 12.07,
LC,"No no no, instead of the discussion, because that would also help me to understand better all of the articles.",,,SC1 12.07,
AI,"OK, OK",,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"OK, So then LC. Yeah, let's leave it to LC. AI, do you wAI help her with that then, or?",,,SC1 12.07,
AI,"Yeah, actually, that's a good idea.",,,SC1 12.07,
AS,Why don't LC and AI do that together then?,,,SC1 12.07,
LC,OK,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"OK, so I'm just going to LC and AI here, OK. And of course, but this is LC and AI will do the putting it together. Yeah, yeah, together part. But everyone has to input the research question answers for their specific articles, because it's not fair if LC and AI have to read all the articles too.",,,SC1 12.07,
HA,Yeah,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"They just have to, yeah. Put the information together. And then when we get after that, then, then we have the discussion and limitations?",,,SC1 12.07,
LC,Yeah,,,SC1 12.07,
HA,Yeah,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,And then recommendations of future research. And then I can do conclusions again because I think the introduction and the conclusion are pretty much the same thing.,,,SC1 12.07,
LC,Yeah,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"Right? And I can just kind of reword it. So, yeah, umm, so the discussion and limitations and recommendations, that's gonna be EN or AI, Umm, HA.",,,SC1 12.07,
HA,"Like, yeah, I I can go for anything of it because I think the most important thing now is analyze it and category After that like we can write the other thing like kind of quick I think. So I am OK to make any and also the introduction part like I, as I send, AS, like I in my reading I I gather a lot of information like that. So if you need it it are you done with that?",,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"together we can do together, yeah.",,,SC1 12.07,
HA,Yeah,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"So EN, do you have a, do you have a preference, discussion of limitations or recommendations for future research?",,,SC1 12.07,
EN,"Yeah, I could do that part.",,,SC1 12.07,
AS,Which one?,,,SC1 12.07,
EN,Discussions on limitations.,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,OK. So EN,,,SC1 12.07,
HA,"Oh I I think it's the LC's part because like, she want to.",,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"No, she switched.",,,SC1 12.07,
LC,It's fine. I'll do the analysis of results.,,,SC1 12.07,
HA,"Oh yeah, Yeah.",,,SC1 12.07,
LC,"And yeah, and then AS, if you need help with the introduction, uh, because it's uh, a lot of terms should be like and reading there and you can tell me as well.",,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"OK, you know what? Maybe I'll go through it again, 'cause the introduction has different parts, has the abstract, has the defining. So maybe we could even split that up a little bit more.",,,SC1 12.07,
LC,"Yeah. We can, like, try to divide, uh, the terms. Because the, the, the thing with the introduction is that we should define everything that we're gonna see later.",,,SC1 12.07,
AS,Yeah,,,SC1 12.07,
LC,"Like which kind of knowledge? Which kind of… Yeah, whatever. So it's a lot.",,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"Yeah. So I'm going through it and then anything I'm missing, just just add it in there. And then does somebody wAI do the… the abstract should be last, right?",,,SC1 12.07,
LC,That's the last thing.,,,SC1 12.07,
HA,Yeah,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,because you won't even worry about that. ,,,SC1 12.07,
EN,xxx,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,What's that? (pause) OK And then recommendations for future research. Should we do that last two or does somebody wAI take that part or.,,,SC1 12.07,
HA,I can,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,What about HA and EN? Then I think it's evenly spread all the work.,,,SC1 12.07,
HA,"Yeah. And anyone like, can feel free to do any yeah, our own stuff.",,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"I agree with that too. Like, if you look, if you like, we should guide each other. Like if read what other people wrote, go, hey, I think this is missing. Or hey, we should add this. Or is this too much?",,,SC1 12.07,
HA,Yeah,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"AI, did you say something?",,,SC1 12.07,
AI,"No, I just agreed. I think that's great if we can all do something because I don't know if I'll have time this week, but then I'll have more time next week or something like that, you know?",,,SC1 12.07,
HA,Yeah. I hope that we can done get it done very soon.,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,Yeah. OK. So the homework then is for each of us to…,,,SC1 12.07,
HA,Yeah,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"…to do this, yeah, everyone has to input the research, question, answers for the specific articles. That's what each of us has to do. And then everybody else just try to do your own part.",,,SC1 12.07,
LC,"Guys, Is it OK if we put some sort of deadline for the if input of the results? Because otherwise we cannot analyze.",,,SC1 12.07,
HA,Yeah I think I almost done with it just xxx and make it like ,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,when when do you wAI start working on it LC? Like when is a good time for you to start working on it because we can meet the deadline then.,,,SC1 12.07,
LC,I don't know I I I really suck at at looking into dates and time but just you tell me guys when should I start.,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,AI do you have a specific time? Because you're that's your part as well.,,,SC1 12.07,
AI,"I've I put some time for Friday, so by Friday I'd like it to be done.",,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"OK. Is that a EN? HA? Is that OK for you? Friday, having this part done?",,,SC1 12.07,
HA,"Yeah, I that's OK for me, right.",,,SC1 12.07,
LC,"So that means on Friday night I can sit down and start doing my part, right?",,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"So a deadline, Friday morning",,,SC1 12.07,
LC,Yes,,,SC1 12.07,
HA,Yeah,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"And then Friday night you guys can start. Is that, EN that's OK?",,,SC1 12.07,
EN,"Yeah. I think LC has to finish our analysis part. So to enable me do the discussion part, That's what I think.",,,SC1 12.07,
HA,Yeah,,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"Yeah, That's why we gotta keep. Yeah, that's how we move forward. So yeah, I think Friday is OK for everybody then Friday morning. So Friday morning, EN, HA and I have to have our part done, 'cause AI's is done now. And then Friday night, LC and AI will work on that part. And then from there, we can do the rest, the discussion and all of those other things, right?",,,SC1 12.07,
HA,"Yeah, yeah.",,,SC1 12.07,
AS,"And I'll just do do the intro anyways, 'cause there's a lot to write.",,,SC1 12.07,

EN,"Yeah, on Wednesdays.",,,SC1 12.07,
AI,"Oh, for tomorrow. It's kind of hard because Maria wants to join at that time, I think somewhere around that time, right?",,,SC1 12.07,

AS,Hmm,QC,,SC1 12.08,
LC,"Which articles got relevant, just artistical differences and so on.",CON,,SC1 12.08,

LC,Hopefully. Yeah,QC,,SC1 12.15,
AI,In a couple of minutes.,QC,,SC1 12.15,
AS,Yeah. OK Bye.,EXT,,SC1 12.15,
HA,"Bye. And like in five question, which one do you want? AI and EN, like I'm OK with anyone.",ELI,,SC1 12.15,
AI,"So I can start with the first one? I think actually the 4th one is how's the paper structured and how's the language? That's the one about like grammar. That's actually the grammar, right?",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
EN,"Yeah, yeah, I'd like to do that.",QC,,SC1 12.15,
AI,You like to do that?,ELI,,SC1 12.15,

EN,Yeah.,QC,,SC1 12.15,
HA,Yeah. OK Yeah.,QC,,SC1 12.15,
AI,"So I can, I can do the first two, because they're related, you know?",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
HA,OK. So I will go with the 3rd and the last. All right.,QC,,SC1 12.15,
AI,"And then the others, the other ones will help us as well. Should we read quietly now and then?",ELI,,SC1 12.15,
HA,"Yeah. So, like, can we live here now or just stay here?",ELI,,SC1 12.15,
AI,I don't know. I think  Yeah.,QC,,SC1 12.15,

HA,Yeah.,QC,,SC1 12.15,
AI,OK.,QC,,SC1 12.15,
HA,"Yeah. So, yeah.",QC,,SC1 12.15,

HA,"So like EN and like, are you happy with the fault question or do you want. If you want more, feel free to tell me. ",ELI,,SC1 12.15,

HA,Yeah. Don't worry.,EXT,,SC1 12.15,
EN,"I like, I like how you put it. If I want more, I should tell you, don't worry ",EXT,,SC1 12.15,

EN,Yeah yeah.,QC,,SC1 12.15,
HA,OK. So see you at 3:30.,EXT,,SC1 12.15,
AS,So shall we move on to your guys's part then?,ELI,,SC1 12.15,
AI,Yeah.,QC,,SC1 12.15,
HA,Ana like how do you feel when you xxx the article? Like you say something right? But I did not hear because I'm writing.,ELI,,SC1 12.15,
AI,"Ah, do you want me to repeat that? Yeah.",ELI,,SC1 12.15,
HA,"Now the the like, now we move to the peer review, right? So how did you feel when you read there? Like you mentioned something weird, right?",ELI,,SC1 12.15,
AI,"Yeah, Yeah.",QC,,SC1 12.15,
EN,"So I said I I felt like they were word padding, trying to look for like trying to make it seem bulky because I felt some of the tables were not necessary. I've never seen that like the the table carrying the strings, the search strings like didn't seem it won't be the tables but anyways I don't know I I'm just trying so hard not to seem over critical I think. But…",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
HA,"Yeah, it's OK like, yeah, I I, I don't know, but I feel that there's a lot of like effort on the first part and like, yeah, they're good impression.

AI,"Is it recording? Oh, yeah, it is recording. Oh whoops ",ELI,,SC1 12.15,
AS,"Well they have stuff to say about ours too, right. So yeah, it's literally our job like we were given this task of reviewing them. So I don't think we should feel too bad about being critical.",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
EN,Yeah. I think ,EXT,,SC1 12.15,
LC,"Yeah, that's our job.",QC,,SC1 12.15,
EN,"I didn't I didn't put it in document where I think generally I think the their formatting is not consistent. It's yeah, the formatting isn't consistent in terms of site spacing and just arrangement of the documents. I just think it's not consistent.",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
HA,Yeah.,QC,,SC1 12.15,
AI,"Is it? Do you mean that because of the tap that they always did. So there's like space, then the text starts and then establish.",ELI,,SC1 12.15,

AI,"Yeah, that could be. Yeah, I think it's so small. But yeah, that is something we could mention. I know that's, I don't know if that's relevant for scientific writing, but do you need to always do the tab? Do you need to do that? Because it made reading the text really a little bit less fun. Does anyone know that? Because if not then come on.",ELI,,SC1 12.15,
EN,I don't think also OK the let's try I understand. I understand not like I did to xxxx,EXT,,SC1 12.15,
HA,Yeah I feel like that is coming.,EXT,,SC1 12.15,
EN,So I think what I think just looking at this I I think like they need they still need more time to go through this generally. More generally I think if they sit on just read through that stuff again for two more days they'll yeah set little screen ,EXT,,SC1 12.15,
HA,I feel like ,EXT,,SC1 12.15,
EN,…or xxx OK sorry you go. But I just put some. I put my comments by the side I like highlighted maybe a line or something they should they need to change. And then I put the comments beside.,EXT,,SC1 12.15,
AI,Mhm. I see that,QC,,SC1 12.15,
AS,Does one of you actually wAI share your screen just so you so we can ,ELI,,SC1 12.15,
AI,Yeah let me go ahead.,QC,,SC1 12.15,
HA,"I feel like when I read the result and analysis, I feel it's not analysis. it kind of it's just ",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
EN,"Yeah, yeah. The analysis was not well done.",QC,,SC1 12.15,
HA,It's just like put some result on that and leave it like that. I did not see real analysis. I feel like that is is really short.,EXT,,SC1 12.15,
AI,You think like ,ELI,,SC1 12.15,
EN,…so like when you're preparing chicken and then the spices do not get to marinate well into the chicken. Like you just pour the spice on top of chicken and then you just have to eat like that. ,EXT,,SC1 12.15,
AI,Your analysis was not well marinated .,EXT,,SC1 12.15,
EN,Yeah ,QC,,SC1 12.15,
AI,"But I I agree with you that it was short, but I don't know if it's like bad because of that because I mean what they did was analyze it and say this was a self-regulated script, right? This was socially shared regulation, this was whatever. And then they just said which one was, you know, the highest one?",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
HA,"I don't know. Yeah, maybe. I don't know. I just have that feeling.",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
AI,"Yeah, it was short in comparison to what we did. I think what they didn't do is describe how they said something was self-regulated. Right?",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
HA,"And also as Maria mentioned, maybe they need to put some data on that. Like.",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
AI,Yeah,QC,,SC1 12.15,
HA,xxx data so that it will be more persuasive.,EXT,,SC1 12.15,
AI,"Yeah. Something that I also didn't get if you read that because they said OK, H1 based on the fact that the analysis shows that SSRL is most prominent, but the analysis didn't show that. They say that this one is most prominent supported. So we...socially shared regulation here. But if that's the analysis, the tables, the analysis, that's not what that says.",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
HA,"Now, is their hypothesis…the table is their finding. But the one you highlight you are highlighting is their hypothesis based on…",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
AI,We build our hypothesis based on the fact that the analysis has shown.,EXT,,SC1 12.15,
HA,Yeah. I mean they said that generally so socially shared regulation is like prominently bad and because of that they have this hypothesis but then they find that it's not I think so.,QC,,SC1 12.15,
AI,Yeah I just wrote that they maybe they shouldn't say analysis here maybe they should change the words so the fact that something else because,EXT,,SC1 12.15,
HA,"And if it is the fact so who said that I don't know. I don't know like I'm really confused because I feel like I need maybe need more time to read that. And also like in my part I mentioned something. Firstly, ah yeah like but AI do you want to go first with your?",ELI,,SC1 12.15,
AI,"Oh yeah that that's actually a good idea. So I found that they had a, the research question was well done, right? It was straightforward and I found that the analysis did answer that question. You know, they said OK 3-4 times SRL that's the most prominent thing that we found. I think that's fair in that way. And then if you saw there's a visualization of analyzed articles, right, that pretty picture where they said these articles thing, I don't know if that's relevant to the research question.",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
HA,Yeah. And some other things that's not really relevant also.,QC,,SC1 12.15,
AI,"All right. I said then for the discussion, I'm lost on what you're trying to say because the discussion was had nothing to do with the analysis. Like it didn't actually say what the analysis had as a result. You know, that's what I felt. Yeah. That I just gave them other ideas like…",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
EN,"OK, Like, I also, I also noticed that as well also indicated like they they didn't even have any consequence. So, OK, what do we make of this? They didn't even talk about, like after your research, what do we make of it? What are the consequences? Then classroom moving forward, like.",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
HA,Yeah. So kind of like a consistence maybe.,QC,,SC1 12.15,
AS,It sound like you guys are saying that it like you know how we did oh with the night. It's not like how how we did our sections but then we came back together to review each other's. It sound like they did their sections and they didn't come back to see if everybody matched. Is that is that fair?,ELI,,SC1 12.15,
AI,"Kind of, yeah. It sounds like they lost steam at the end.",QC,,SC1 12.15,
LC,"Yeah, it sounds like that.",QC,,SC1 12.15,
AS,"But again, would is it steam at the end or is it that somebody had that last section? Do you know what I mean?",ELI,,SC1 12.15,
AI,"Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't, actually. I can't tell if someone was written by someone else or not.",QC,,SC1 12.15,
HA,"Yeah, Can I? I'm still with my…Okay, so my part is about the theoretical knowledge. I feel like you know like when when we read it we have very good impression all that part very well written and very detailed manner. But after reading all of that and like go to the research question. So I find like there are not all of the theories mentioned relevant to the result question. For example, I feel like only two do think that relevant is the scripting in CSCL and regulation in CSCL. However they have a 12/12 like categorize and subcategories in in that part so I think it's too many. So maybe what I suggest here is maybe they only like emphasize and put are like right more right like in more detail about two main categories which are scripting in CRCL and regulation in CRCL and also the sub-categories. They put it maybe in the form of table or graphic, but still I feel for example they mentioned over scripting, flexibility script, micro and macro script. They have nothing to do with the research question, honestly.",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
AI,True.,QC,,SC1 12.15,
HA,"Yeah, it's very very long with 12 uh sub-categories. So I like maybe in order to make it more neatly and comprehensive and logically they can like put it in a table or just maybe.",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
AI,"Yeah, mentioned some things for example, overscripting can literally just be a definition, right? So they could just put that there like as a table.",INT,,SC1 12.15,
HA,Yeah.,QC,,SC1 12.15,
AI,"Microscripting, Macroscripting, I agree scripting and CSCL also isn't, hmm, yeah.",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
HA,But like there is a question like they are not solving the problem of like type of script. I I feel it's just like they put it there and also of course in the analysis they have some coding yeah yeah the tax of script. But again that coding I don't know. They did not directly answer the research question.,EXT,,SC1 12.15,
AI,Should I say that or should I mention that the coding like you mentioned coding in the analysis but we don't fully understand like,ELI,,SC1 12.15,
HA,I don't know…And also…yeah come on.,QC,,SC1 12.15,
EN,"OK, maybe you take can you be a little bit can you be clearer with the coding in this part or?",ELI,,SC1 12.15,
AI,I can't put that in the…,EXT,,SC1 12.15,
HA,I think like after today I will like Polish my writings. I will try to write like more politely in scientific style maybe.,EXT,,SC1 12.15,
AI,You mean the comments or when our our paper.,ELI,,SC1 12.15,
HA,My comment.,QC,,SC1 12.15,
AI,"I write like I wrote, ""it looks cool"" and I'm keeping that . It's fine. I don't think we need to be very professional with the comments, right? Just give them a thing.",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
HA,And also in the theoretical uh grounding.,EXT,,SC1 12.15,
AI,Mm hmm.,QC,,SC1 12.15,
HA,I feel like only the only the theories but not the opinion and evaluation. Maybe they there could be a link to their own research for example. Is there any lacking in current research like what have not been covered and established and what you want to challenge? I don't know like maybe I just feel like it's just only the theory and like they what I expect is that they will like you know direct the reader like kind of they direct the reader two word. There is a question like gradually like this…,EXT,,SC1 12.15,
AI,That’s true yeah.,QC,,SC1 12.15,
HA,…but I just feel I go through like many different thing and cannot see the connection between them. For example ,EXT,,SC1 12.15,
AI,"They also didn't really like what's the point of the research question kind of like they didn't really make me be like, oh this is a good research question, you know.",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
HA,Yeah.,QC,,SC1 12.15,
AI,"I don't, I don't see the reason for it per se.",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
HA,"Yeah. So like maybe like when, for example, when we read the theoretical grounding and we feel like when we read it and we are they mentioned it but there's the lacking and like and this it is and then and then it really makes sense when you go, how is reasonable when they put the research question because of those lacking. But…",INT,,SC1 12.15,
AI,"I get what you mean. Yeah, I think that's something relevant because I mean, yeah, I don't think that's something they can easily change. But yeah, I see what you.",QC,,SC1 12.15,
HA,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And also in the the articles that they applied in this paper, like do you think 9 is a good number? I don't know. I just asked. I don't have the experience about it.",ELI,,SC1 12.15,
AI,"I think for six weeks 9 is OK Yeah, patient right. LC, you are muted.",QC,,SC1 12.15,
LC,But like we got 19.,CON,,SC1 12.15,
HA,Yeah.,QC,,SC1 12.15,
LC,"And like I mean it is hard to find, but maybe maybe a few more, I don't know.",CON,,SC1 12.15,
AI,"Yeah, that's just, that's also like even if we give them that feedback, they can't change anything about the paper, can they?",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
LC,"Well, that's true, you're right.",QC,,SC1 12.15,
HA,"Yeah, just just a feedback and then they just submit the final trap and they will receive credits for sure. So whatever they submit, they will receive the credits, I'm sure. So, so like, just give the feedback. I don't know.",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
AI,"Should we maybe change that the number of nine articles is considered OK, but could be better?",ELI,,SC1 12.15,
HA,"Yeah, maybe maybe.",QC,,SC1 12.15,
LC,"Yeah, maybe for them to know, like, you know, for the next occasion they have to do a scientific paper in six weeks. They should include articles.",QC,,SC1 12.15,
HA,"And also, they only use Google Scholar. But like, we can suggest that.",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
LC,"That's like a major suggestion. Yeah, they need to use more yeah.",CON,,SC1 12.15,
HA,"Yeah, more diverse could be included. Yeah, I think that's all. What else?",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
AI,"I think their biggest issue is still...OK. So the guiding towards the research question. Actually, maybe I can mention that not as you say it because the aim is maybe research mentioned well answered in one person.",EXT,,SC1 12.15,

EN,"I'm sorry, can you take it easy? Sorry, sorry.",ELI,,SC1 12.15,

EN,"Okay. But I'm I'm, I'm gonna have to do that later. I'm just past my closed time. I think I'm just getting set to leave the office now. So even when I get back home and I'm settled, I'll do it.",CON,,SC1 12.15,

AI,"By the way, I wrote down our group isn't fully done with the final bits yet, so maybe you're in the same boat. So you did it very personally, just to not offend anyone, you know. I hope you all agree we're not done with the paper yet, right? We still have like some fixing to do.",EXT,,SC1 12.15,

LC,Ah asterisk? ,QC,,SC1 12.15,
HA,Yeah. So the they are the article that we analyze so like we don't have the list of article right? But in the reference list they put that symbol before the article that included in our analysis. So like do you want to do something like that Like I don't want to bring more work but just as that's something just.,EXT,,SC1 12.15,

LC,"That can be done. I've never seen that before, but have you found it?",QC,,SC1 12.15,
HA,"Yeah, because maybe one question they may ask when they read our papers that like what exactly are the article? Maybe that they can Scroll down and find it. But like I saw like an article, they put that symbol before to mark that this is the article that included in the literature review. But like no worries. It's not like thing really it's not a big deal.",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
LC,I'm gonna put it in the To Do List.,QC,,SC1 12.15,
HA,Yeah just tell me if you if I can help you with anything in my ability.,EXT,,SC1 12.15,
AS,"I honestly think in my opinion, one of the critiques we're gonna get is that our research questions are hard to differentiate.",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
AI,Do you think?,ELI,,SC1 12.15,
AS,"Yeah, because even like every time I'm trying to write, like even when I was doing this presentation, like I'm trying to like separate the content or intent of both of them and it's so, so similar. Like, yeah, why do we need to, you know what I mean? But they're not exactly the same. It's just because even think about it, like as we were doing this entire paper, we kept rewording and shaping them. So yeah, I know, maybe if they say nothing, we change nothing.",EXT,,SC1 12.15,
LC,"So, yeah, oh, but not that, Just not just that. Now that you say that when you were talking in the presentation about like the questions, the research questions, you first mentioned one research question that changed and then it became the real research question. Maybe it might be confusing for some like what? How like, how did it change? I don't know. It seemed to me it could be confusing.
So maybe like be like make sure to differentiate or like to like, these are the, like, let's put like on it.",EXT,,SC1 12.15,

LC,Yeah.,QC,,SC1 12.15,

HA,"No, their article.",CON,,SC1 12.15,
AI,The article is super long. You mean the first part?,ELI,,SC1 12.15,

I just felt this topic so close to our learning, especially to my learning at university and I see how teachers also lack a lot of, of knowledge in how to instruct and how to approach scripting, how to promote collaborative groups, and I felt like really close to me this lack of support, lack of organization. Uh, many, many, different issues related to online learning, specially at university levels or any, I would say, also, high school or like with adults, sort of, which is not the focus. I mean like, I’m in, early childhood, so I was thinking of how to apply it there, but it's I'm not really interested in that honestly, like it would be cool to apply it in early childhood, but because as with B, like, it's my field, I feel comfortable, I know Pedagogy and so on. However, I feel like that will come eventually and I'm more interested in in kind of figuring out how to solve the problems that we are facing now as students in a higher level, like, yeah.

Yeah that's why I like general of all kinds of affordances, primarily educational, hedonistic, to facilitate language learning, especially cooperative aspects, especially my thesis topic is test, like testing the feasibility of a prototype cooperative language practice test.",EXT,F,SA2 11.12,

B,Hah,QC,,SA2 11.12,
S,How we can identify with the those aspects. ,INT,F,SA2 11.12,
V,"Yeah. I'm really interested in primary as well, like I, I got actually when I applied to this university, I got admitted first in primary and then I'm like, primary, early childhood primary, and then I went to early childhood. But primary is also a field, plus we also here in Finland, we study early childhood and pre-primary and also like we are studying how to cooperate with primary teachers in transitions and so on. So knowledge is somehow related and interconnected.",INT,OT,SA2 11.12,
B,"Yeah, that's really good. Yeah, when I did my response in Finland I also saw that it's very, very connected, because in Spain there are two different degrees, so there is no link between each other and I feel this is a, a important issue, because we have no idea what they do in early childhood and they don't have any idea what they are doing in school. ",INT,OT,SA2 11.12,
V,Exactly,QC,OT,SA2 11.12,
B,"So, yeah. But yeah, let's see. Now I'm thinking how could we choose a contest that we find enough literature about it, because I don't know if there is gonna be enough literature about CSCL,  not CSCL, but you know more or less this topic related with primary education, I don't know.",EXT,F,SA2 11.12,
V,"Yeah, I mean we have to somehow focus on social interactions, learning for sure we talk this, learning big, concept that we can apply to every, like… I think we have a very broad topic that we have to narrow it down like as much as we can so it's easier for us to kind of keep us focused on one, like, one kind of problematic, because I was thinking when I was reading this, this articles, I was thinking that, that like again and again is like in, there's problems in, in the the CSCL environment that fails to promote social interaction and thus social presence and social space and so on and so on, so and in some articles said: “OK, the responsibility is on the tool we are using in some sense that the responsibility is in the people that are actually using the tool, so there are many, kind of focus, focus on…""",EXT,F,SA2 11.12,
B, Yeah.,QC,F,SA2 11.12,
V,sort of problematics.,EXT,F,SA2 11.12,
B,"Yeah, I also saw that there is also a program related with that with the failing in the social presence in CSCL and it's that they think providing tools like forums will work, but in fact they are not working, because every, we co- and we could see the reasons why forum does, does not work because sometimes it's because people feel pressure about writing, sometimes it's because people can't express themselves that well and sometimes it's because it requires time and you don't receive any feedback after writing…",INT,F,SA2 11.12,
V,Mhm.,QC,F,SA2 11.12,
B, …so many things about.,INT,F,SA2 11.12,

B,Yeah.,QC,F,SA2 11.12,
S,"Yeah, yes, and that's one actually relevant context is. Actually teams, like what we're doing right now it's a very meta kind approach, but I'll give you an example. When I was in this channel, I wanted, my first reflex was to create a new section for Microsoft OneNote.",INT,F,SA2 11.12,
V,Mhm.,QC,F,SA2 11.12,
S,"Yes, and but because, but that's what happens in your team when you have it. When you assign a channel, you are, yeah basically it's, I don't, it doesn't seem to be possible for me in terms of usability. That kind of discouraged because I integrate one note with my everything with my personal life. So that's one aspect, that the way they put us in this channel, already limited my perception, or, you know, not my perception. But yeah, my inclination towards…",CON,,SA2 11.12,
V,Yeah.,QC,,SA2 11.12,
B,Yeah.,QC,,SA2 11.12,

V,"Yeah, I, I was when, when we finished the meeting last time you said: “Hey they created the channel for us!” and I went to teams I was like “I'm not in the channel they didn't put me, what I'm gonna do?”, I contact my teacher, no reply nothing, I was like, well I don't know and then I was like oh here I am and lots of things. I was like “I hate this already”. I was so discouraged to do anything, hah! ",EXT,,SA2 11.12,
B,"I'm, I'm thinking that maybe it could be cool, I mean it's just an idea to analyze different UM platforms for example teams, for example there is also well, I don't, I know my platform from UNI, but I don't know what is the real name, because it's called Prado, but it doesn't have anything to... Maybe you think about platforms from your Uni, uh, we could analyze how do they promote aaa social presence in, through the platform, because maybe by analyzing them we can see the the pros and the cons they have, well, they what they have in common. Uh, I don't know. It could be maybe, interesting to, to do something that it's applicable, you know, because if we do, if we write an article and it's just about reading, it's cool, but in the end we are not going to, to, to get something new and relevant.

V,Yeah. B nods.,QC,F,SA2 11.12,
S,"Trust me, I've, 'cause with my thesis, I've been worn just because I spent a whole two months being told by everyone that I'm trying to do too much. So from a recent experience I'll tell you - just picking teams, and it's actually a really big, you know, it's already, you probably heard and read and into it it that we're using non educational tools for educational, for education as primary tools in to facilitate it, so actually to analyze how, what are the affordances social, educational and hedonistic of teams. And really, like taking that framework like that, those definite could actually like disentangling what are those affordance, the definition of the affordances…",CON,F,SA2 11.12,

B,Yeah.,QC,F,SA2 11.12,
V,"I,  I like the concept of affordances a lot. I've been studying them a lot, especially in early childhood and and there it's many research done on what affordances mean, just like by the term. However, we can like put it what are the affordances of teams, for example, and how and at what extent it promotes social interaction and maybe we can make it practical as well, like, what are the affordances also from different actors like teachers or students or whatever.",INT,F,SA2 11.12,

V,"We are discussing a, Stef, he left, his flatmate forgot the keys something, so he's gonna be out for two minutes or so, but he's coming back. And we were, just to update you a little bit, We, we, were talking about basically what we're interested in and maybe we can tell you more about that. B is in primary, I am in early childhood and we were talking about the affordances of different platforms. B suggested to do something practical so it's not just theoretical, but just to analyze, for example, how teams works in a way to support social interaction or social presence. So we were going in that area more or less. ",INT,P,SA2 11.12,
O,"OK, so we are going to carry something like some empirical research? Might be some kind of a gather… What, what is, what is it called again? Stop. We are going to have to gather data right? I mean just some kind of…",ELI,F,SA2 11.12,
V,"We, we, this is a literature research.",EXT,F,SA2 11.12,
B,"So yeah, it will be a literature research. But we it's not an empirical research, because for empirical research we have to do, like, we have to take a sample, we have to take data, we have to analyze data and we were just thinking about doing a literature research and in one moment of the research we can provide something new. It's not only about reviewing the literature, we can provide something related with our analysis of Teams, and I'm sure there is something written about Teams…",CON,F,SA2 11.12,
V, Yes.,QC,,SA2 11.12,

V,Yeah.,QC,,SA2 11.12,
B,Yeah. ,QC,,SA2 11.12,
O,"Oh, OK, uhm exactly this does, not exactly required that we gather data from maybe people using teams, right?",ELI,F,SA2 11.12,
V,"Yeah, maybe we can do that. I I'm not. Yeah, maybe we can do that, but, I think we have to agree on the way that we kind of collect data because the, the, the, the Sabrina, our tutor, She said like we don't have to collect data. ",CON,F,SA2 11.12,
O,Yeah.,QC,F,SA2 11.12,
V,"She said, like, just you know, do literature review, like, gather different articles and find a problematic that other researchers are trying to find answers to. So she said that is no need to collect the data in this case. However, I guess we can do whatever we want.",CON,F,SA2 11.12,
B,"Yeah, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't go in this field because we don't have time for writing, right?",CON,F,SA2 11.12,
O,"Aaaaa, going, going with team, uh as well, we're going to target, UM, are we sure we are getting a a lot of literatures about him, I mean Teams within already. I wish I would be able to get that because, I mean, if we lack literature, what the reveal would be it, might be a challenge actually. So we, we have to consider something that, uhm, we can easily get some articles about them, about it, and things like that other platform that is maybe common and or people who use it often, because as for me, I've never used Team until I joined the Saarland University, so it's something I've not used before. But I know Moodle is something that's more common and some other teaching platform so, I'm, I'm just thinking we should look at something that when we research and when we look at literature we will be able to get things to, you know, work on.

V,Yeah.,QC,F,SA2 11.12,

B,Yeah. ,QC,F,SA2 11.12,
S, Very promising.,QC,F,SA2 11.12,
O,"Yeah so, maybe we just have to like, not stick to one, pick a few, make some a search check if we can lay our hands on reasonable amounts of literature for, for whichever one is better off or we can pick it up.",EXT,F,SA2 11.12,
V,Yeah. Yea. ,QC,F,SA2 11.12,
B,"Yeah, sorry. Go, go ahead. Go ahead.",QC,,SA2 11.12,
V,"No, go, go, go.",CON,,SA2 11.12,
B,"I was gonna say that uh I think it's gonna be difficult in half an hour to come with a very good topic right now, so we can keep discussing but we can create a a chart or something where we can write like topic, uh, resources that we found related with the topic and our name just to see who wrote each idea. And maybe then we, we can, we have more than one topic, because now it's very difficult to to figure out more than one idea, I think. ",INT,F,SA2 11.12,

I used it yesterday and I've been away since today so I had to run back or I run, run back home, because of the meeting and now I trying to join with my laptop and it's messing up so I'm glad I'm hearing this.",EXT,OT,SA2 11.12,

O,"Fascinated me? OK, about the social stuff, uhm, well, um, my first choice. Like I said, there was a scripting and then my second was social aspect. I went for social aspect because I'm we can see that, I mean the four of us are of different race and I'm literally interested in getting to know more about about relationship with other students, regardless of race and everything, how we interact apart from, um even with a class activities and everything, how we interact and all of that. When I joined the UM, my university newly, I mean right now I'm still joining from my country. I'm not, UM, in Germany yet and then, uhm, people’s way of life differ, but we are still human in general and then the way we interact our social life, our, the way we do things and all of that. Somehow it differs but sometimes we come to a kind of juncture where we, I mean we meet to interact, irrespective of our race. We work on a team, collaborate like we are doing right now and I'm interested to know, I mean how, how better we can go or how perfect we can work as a team without, um, having good social interaction regardless of where we're coming from, what language we understand or speak, or how generally our culture differ, so I'm very much interested as an international student who eventually meets different students from different, aaa, background. Generally, I think social life of a student is a very vital aspect of learning, so I'm interested in getting to know much and more about that.",EXT,F,SA2 11.12,
V,"(V, B and S nods). Nice. I share your interest, hm . ",QC,F,SA2 11.12,
S,"Definitely, like, and it's part of that social presence, The realness and how, how it can be done in let's say formal contexts. Let's say if, if we don't find the time to hang out, virtually there's still a chance we can like see our, see each other, just you know, yeah, like…",INT,F,SA2 11.12,
O,Yeah.,QC,,SA2 11.12,
S," and what's what makes it like, what are the ways to do that, 'cause you know, you know in one of the, one of the key takeaways from me was the social presence that apparently in the 90s, they've already proved that social presence can be established with the text only, but then, only…",INT,,SA2 11.12,
V,Mhm.,QC,,SA2 11.12,
B,Mhm.  ,QC,,SA2 11.12,
S, …change. ,INT,,SA2 11.12,
V,Yeah.,QC,,SA2 11.12,
S,"But then I don't know. I kind of lean against towards scripting, again, 'cause this is kinda how you can prompt these talks or…",CON,,SA2 11.12,
V,Yeah.,QC,,SA2 11.12,
S,"But, anyway.",EXT,,SA2 11.12,
V,"Yeah, I was, I was reading an article and that was one of the questions, was like how we can promote social interaction in an asynchronous CSCL environment, which is highly theoretical, but it's quite interesting as well. If even, if we choose another like, I think that it could be applied, for example in teams. Like that question, it could be easily ask in many different environments.",EXT,,SA2 11.12,
B,"That's really interesting. That's the thing that, when I read about everything related with social present in CSCL, all the questions were already addressing it, you know, because everything you can think it's about UM, how to, to know other people by UM online situation how you can work collaboratively and by using computers and all that. I, everything is already addressing it, so that's why I was trying to think about something, or no or not practical or different, because all of the articles are addressing the same thing at the same time, you know?",ELI,,SA2 11.12,
V,Mhm.,QC,,SA2 11.12,
B,"cause if not, I don't know what can we, I, I know the, the word in Spanish, but what can we give, you know with this article?",ELI,,SA2 11.12,
V,"Yeah, what can we add into the existing knowledge that we have already, like that people have sort of. ",QC,,SA2 11.12,
S,"Sometimes, it's taken, even they propose, like so few constructs, so taking one and then like really analyzing it, explaining what it actually means, Because I'll give you an example like a hedonistic affordance, like Hedonist City, and that's 2018 article, not that, but there is that, there was a referred 2018 article, they do refer to of course gamification as one good term of course, widgets that, but, uh, and mentioned that there's only one real work that talked about online collaborative learning environments that were there was an attempt at that, but I could disentangle. I'll tell you from experience when people say gamification, they're like, OK, cool, gamification, yeah, we get it. But what aspects of gamification, because in that actually in that referred article that, that I checked out again, the definition is so vague.",EXT,,SA2 11.12,
V,Mhm.,,,SA2 11.12,
S," So basically I'll ended up thinking, yeah, in abstract terms, you kind of explain it. But what specifically, what specific features of gamification? If you had to go to that details the nitty gritty detail that actually makes all the difference.",EXT,,SA2 11.12,
V,Yeah.,QC,,SA2 11.12,
B,"Yeah, ",QC,,SA2 11.12,
S,‘cause.,EXT,,SA2 11.12,
B," Yeah, yeah, that's sometimes we just go through all the innovations and we just read our word and we think that the topic is going to be amazingly explained and we don't go that deep into the definitions of some, some things, yeah.",QC,,SA2 11.12,
V,Yeah. ,QC,,SA2 11.12,
S,"I'm not a fan of this, but just saying that we do have that option of, that's more like, hey, this is that one concept that you liked, but you were not sure, and if we, we check with each other hey, in other words, can really describe it in detail, maybe because as a lack of.",CON,,SA2 11.12,

V,"Yeah. So if we would have to think, UM, basically we have to like, narrow it down to sort of a topic, we're not gonna do this now, I don't aim to do this now, but it's, what, what would you say that it's like a problematic that interesting you? What would you like to know? Like B, for example? What do would you like to, to, to get out of this, this article that we have to write?",ELI,F,SA2 11.12,
B,I'm thinking .,EXT,F,SA2 11.12,
V,"Anybody, I mean? So we, we have to, like focus on somehow on, on some problematic or something that we're interested to, to give answer to.",ELI,F,SA2 11.12,
B,"I would say that. A way of showing social presence is by giving support, right? ",ELI,F,SA2 11.12,
V,Mhm.,QC,F,SA2 11.12,
B,"And somehow it could work, because for example, here in our master we have like Tutors and they give us supports and I don't know them, but they, they are really taking care of us. We can ask them questions we know they are there, you know, you know it's about knowing that they are somewhere, but they can help you, so, I would know more about how this support can affect the way you work in a CSCL situation. You know, because I've I feel after having this support I feel more motivated to work because I know I'm not alone working on that, you know.",EXT,F,SA2 11.12,

S,Promoting and supporting social presence.,INT,F,SA2 11.12,
B,Yeah.,QC,F,SA2 11.12,
V,"Mhm. So maybe we can kind of, think in, in which ways, we can promote social presence and maintain social presence, in certain CSCL environments and then, from there, look at their affordances or specific like, we were talking about Teams, for example. OK, so with this like sort of kind of like continuity of thoughts.",INT,F,SA2 11.12,
B,Mhm.,QC,F,SA2 11.12,
V," So we, we see, OK, there might be problems, What are these problems and, and, and then how can we actually do it?",ELI,F,SA2 11.12,
B,Mhm. ,QC,F,SA2 11.12,
V,"And, and then take a look at the, at the tool that we are actually using to do this article and put it under scope and to see, yeah, what it allows us to do or how much or how far.",EXT,F,SA2 11.12,
B,Hm. Yeah.,QC,F,SA2 11.12,
S,"It’s true. Also, the tricky part would be again, because we're in a dedicated channel, we have limited ownership. This is the funny aspect. Once you have your own team, then well, there's, that's another aspect of actually empowerment and feeling of ownership. But you, really like honestly, when I when I came out, I tried to do this and I was like oh I can't like **** and I felt like. You know, there's that you know shared, shared ownership is…",CON,F,SA2 11.12,
V,Mhm. ,QC,F,SA2 11.12,

B,I'm pretty…,EXT,,SA2 11.12,

S,Yes.,QC,,SA2 11.12,
V,Yeah. ,QC,,SA2 11.12,
O,"So I was thinking relationship, uh or interaction amongst team members or students can also UM, UM, UM, contribute to social, social presence, so I don't know if it's something we can add to as an aspect we could look at. I mean the students interaction, using the the UM, the online space, so…",EXT,F,SA2 11.12,
V,Mhm.,QC,F,SA2 11.12,
O,"I mean, somehow I observed that with my experience, I think students, UM, seem to be socially attracted or interacts more when there's a physi-, it's the classes in a physical space kind of, for instance, classmates. If we do have classes in class and all of that will interact and everything, I think the bond is to be more or less, like more fun than online, so somehow, somehow, because we are from different locations, we only see where we make online and all of that I think how it affects our students with relationship or how students relationship affects social presence is another aspect we could look at, oh and talk because for instance, if you find yourself that in a class or in a meeting you're visible, you acknowledged, uhm, you you ahead, you can actually be always you, want always, I mean, be available and contribute. But when it appears like, oh, uhm, this I mean when there are some kind of, uh, shortcomings, and you find yourself calling back to your shell, somehow can affect the student's social presence.",EXT,F,SA2 11.12,

B,"I, I have an idea coming soon, I'm sorry.",EXT,F,SA2 11.12,
O,(inaudible) Yeah. Students relationship on the online space is another aspect.,QC,F,SA2 11.12,
B,"Yeah, yeah, I was thinking that, uh, I don't know, in countries like in Spain, O, can you mute yourself because I hear noise?",ELI,,SA2 11.12,
O,Yeah.,QC,,SA2 11.12,
B,"Great, thank you. Yeah, I was thinking that if for example in Spain, uh, with all these coronavirus and the pandemic and everything in schools, or every school, have to adopt the school for this CSCL situation because they were working through computers and they were working in Teams and everything, so we can, maybe there are some literature about how these situations affect a student's relationships. You know how working only online, uh, affect their, their relationship within each other or something.",EXT,F,SA2 11.12,
V,"Yeah. Yeah, that's really interesting to look at, but like?.",EXT,F,SA2 11.12,
O,"I recently heard that, I had an experience and I think it's something to study. We are taking a a HCI, don't know if any of you register for the course and then I happen to like, join three groups. The first I joined, uh, we work. We were actually almost deciding on how to carry on and then the two person said, oh already they, they are in Germany and they wouldn't want to, I think they are new students anyway so we are used to using the teams already because we started last year so for them, the two of them said, oh, we are in Germany and we wouldn't like to work online. And I mean we don't get to see ourselves sometime so we can come out, decide to come into the school environment and meet. “So, oh please, how soon can you be here?” I told them well, my job, my visa is still on process and I hope to be there soon. They said, oh, since I'm not sure, they are not comfortable completing a group task even though it was specifically for online. So they actually said, yeah, sorry they would have to look for someone in Germany who can decide, agree to meet sometimes physically and that was it. And I had to leave the group and then the second group seems to re-, meanwhile, this particular project was divided into 2, those who can come face to face in class and virtual, so we chose virtual and therefore we chat choosing visual. I expect that that's it. Nothing,  I mean it's very perfect online, because that's actually what it is for,  but then to them, I don't know, maybe they haven't had to work like that, they said they can't just seem to like complete a group task without having to meet in the physical space, time to time, so, looking at this, I mean, it's, as I mean, as a person it has affected me. I had formed a group and joined the group. I had to start looking out for another, so I felt I felt bad because it's not like it's my choice not to be in Germany yet. I still wanted to. I've been so desiring to, but some challenges from the lockdown and everything in my country has kept me, so as a student I felt really, I felt really bad because I was already planning with them so. You see this in one way or the other affects, affects people…",EXT,F,SA2 11.12,
V,Mhm.,QC,F,SA2 11.12,
O," so, I’m, I, I think it's aspects worthy of study too, so….",EXT,F,SA2 11.12,
V,"Yeah, definitely.",QC,F,SA2 11.12,
O,Yeah. ,QC,F,SA2 11.12,
V,"I feel like, between like student relationships, like you, just B and you O, wanna you said like, treated (inaudible)...",INT,P,SA2 11.12,
B,"Wait, wait, wait, O do you can, you can, you mute yourself? Because I, there you go.",ELI,,SA2 11.12,
V,"A, like if there was, it was one aspect in terms of how student relationship affects social presence in CSCL environments and the other turn is how CSCL affects relationships like…",INT,P,SA2 11.12,
B,Yeah. ,QC,P,SA2 11.12,
V," It's two different, like scopes or where to look at this subject and I think it's really, really interesting both, however, I wouldn't dare to treat both in one article.",CON,P,SA2 11.12,
B,"No, no, no, no!",QC,P,SA2 11.12,
V, would be too complicated. ,CON,P,SA2 11.12,
B,"We have to do it really, really specific, because if not, we wouldn't have time.",EXT,P,SA2 11.12,
V,"So, looking at the at the page that the, the, the when we have online, we have the, the first kind of idea for topic, was promoting and supporting social presence and then we have student interaction among members that contribute to social presence, so maybe we can select two or three kind of topics that could promote social presence, for example student interaction, so then we see how student interaction promotes social presence, how teachers supposed to support social presence and how students themselves support social presence. Maybe we can, you know, the topic, one of promoting.",INT,P,SA2 11.12,
B,Yes. ,QC,P,SA2 11.12,
V,"…  and so on to student interaction so we can kind of build a broad, more comprehensive topic according to our interests.",INT,P,SA2 11.12,
B,"Yes, and all this you mean in a CSCL environment, right?",ELI,P,SA2 11.12,
V,"Yeah, yeah.",QC,P,SA2 11.12,
S,"Yeah, this, this main, main graph that professor Krejins elaborate on quite concisely, the lasts before the at risk points,  It's kind of presenting all almost all the variables, um, that affects social space, of course, this relate to performance, but really, in terms social, actually, yeah, in terms of social presence. Maybe it's not the same. No, it's not the same. But anyway, just it's one point of reference to get ideas for which variable…",EXT,,SA2 11.12,
B,Yeah.,QC,,SA2 11.12,
S," might, 'cause it can be just dispositions, like, what O, experiences is, yep, attitude towards online learning and collaborative online learning. And there's of course, there's pessimists and there's *****, let's be honest, sometimes it's just. Probably I was * **** to someone and I didn't notice it.",EXT,,SA2 11.12,
V,"Yeah, I mean we have on one side, I'm looking like you just mentioned social performance, social space, social and emotional processes and then we have also on the upper one, we have, also, all  pedagogical techniques. ",INT,P,SA2 11.12,
B,"Yeah, yeah.",QC,P,SA2 11.12,
V,"I think we need to pick, to choose and …",EXT,P,SA2 11.12,
B,"Yes, yes.",QC,P,SA2 11.12,
V,… Something from here.,EXT,P,SA2 11.12,
B,"Yes, I was going to say that we can go, we, we are now talking and it's super fine to talk about what we think about this topic and everything because it's a good way to start, but for going more specific I think we should just create simple, say OK, we are gonna study the dispositions, and in CSCL environment that is, decision of the students, so we are going to study the attitude toward group,  toward group learning, the outcome, beliefs and expectations and we can choose just two or three things and they will, I think, we will find a lot of information about that because everybody wants to know how a group work works. So, I think we can just try to choose something we really like from here and go ahead with that because I think we it's, it's a not a losing of time but it's, it's good to to go directly to something, then try to open it and think about something really opened, and then it's gonna be completely unmanageable.",CON,P,SA2 11.12,
V,"Yeah, agreed. Agreed. ",QC,P,SA2 11.12,
B,Great .,QC,P,SA2 11.12,
S,"So, but in terms of what, so absolutely 100% on the same page, well in terms of, so are we at a stage where we kind of, say social presence seems to kind of interest all of us more, and variables that affect it, might be something to lookout for. But we should still be open to other. Like a social presence versus social space. That's my like, just to make sure that, we're still open to exploring focusing on that aspect of social space or just presence up to you, I'm easy.",CON,P,SA2 11.12,
V,"I think that, like even though we can focus on one thing, but we can also like as we go, bring other things into questioning, like, we need to narrow it down, but that doesn't mean that we cannot bring all the things into the topics. For example, we can still analyze, I still really like what B said that analyze Teams, for example, I really like that part and not gonna be included, even though we decide to focus on. Anything else?",CON,P,SA2 11.12,
O,"Oh, OK, I I just thought about something because like, like, like rightly said we if we have too much things to look at and we just have one article that, that shouldn't be that much to write, now we just need to narrow what we have, we have already to something, doable. So I am just thinking that outside all we have suggested, I think we should look at a topic like, how come use the use of team or online, UM collaboration affecting, so sorry, how are the use of Teams affects our students social presence in online collaboration, something like that, because obviously we need to have a topic and then we, we now it, actually from the topic that we get what we call, something like dependent and independent variable, things of that nature and then work on. So first we need to get ahead in a topic, a general topic, there from the topic is where we get the other variables to tackle in it. So we need to have an umbrella topic, so I am suggesting we feel something like how, oh, did use of teams affect students social presence in collaborative setting..",EXT,P,SA2 11.12,
S,From the point of view AFFORDANCES!,EXT,P,SA2 11.12,
O,"Yeah, yeah .",QC,P,SA2 11.12,
V,"Yeah, we need to have a research question, so we need to be concise and specific.",QC,P,SA2 11.12,
B,"That's the thing, that for me, social presence is really, really open. We need to go with something more specific, because if you just say how it, how the use of team affect social presence, social presence, I still think that it's really big, because the use of teams can be the use of the microphone, the use of the camera, the use of the channel, the use of the, so there are so many things that we cannot talk about everything.",CON,P,SA2 11.12,
V,Yes. ,QC,P,SA2 11.12,
S,"First the definition. Well, the affordance would be social affordances primarily. Then, like I don't know the definition of social affordances.",EXT,P,SA2 11.12,
B,Me neither.,QC,P,SA2 11.12,
S,"But that might be, some might be some framework that would help us too…",ELI,P,SA2 11.12,
V,"I like that. I like that. So, what are the social affordances that could potentially contribute and help the maintenance of social presence in CSCL environments? There we have it. ",INT,P,SA2 11.12,
B,Mmm . ,QC,P,SA2 11.12,
V,"I don't know, I'm just trying to put all the things together. And then we look at dispositions. We look at pedagogical, we can look like to one thing in particular.",INT,P,SA2 11.12,
B,Yeah.,QC,P,SA2 11.12,
V,"Plus I mean, even though I feel, I feel the same, like I said very… ",CON,P,SA2 11.12,
O, I think first of all we need enough social presence.,EXT,P,SA2 11.12,
V,Yep?,ELI,P,SA2 11.12,
O,"So, uhm, I think we need to understand what social presence means and then, UM, as an aspect. I think, UM, I don't remember the video, but I know it's an aspect of the social, social. Think there's two videos, one is social, one soft, then the other one is in social-emotional, right? Am I correct? From the video we watched?",ELI,P,SA2 11.12,
B,"Yeah, I think it was like that. I don't remember well but, I know what are you referring, but yeah, go ahead.",QC,P,SA2 11.12,
O,"Yeah, and then we have, I think we had SPS or something like that, so show sociality, social presence and social. Oh, I mean I watched that video once but I was trying to deduce something from that because I think from the SPS, it aspect of it the social presence is one aspect of the three of below it, which, so I don't think it's too big to look at holistically.",EXT,P,SA2 11.12,
V,I think we can just focus on social affordances. ,CON,P,SA2 11.12,
B,"Yes, yes.",QC,P,SA2 11.12,
V,"I mean, yeah. I mean we have social presence, automatically leads to problems, problems in social presence and what are these problems arising and, and from that focus on the social affordances, and how they affect, and how like, I'm trying to say, what are the social affordances that prevent social presence to happen and what are the social affordances that, in the contrary, do help social presence to happen. ",INT,P,SA2 11.12,
B,Yes,QC,P,SA2 11.12,
V,And then we look at the sociability of  CSCL environments or certain or like specific CLCL environments and then we focus on Teams.,INT,P,SA2 11.12,
B,"I would say it's too much because. Yeah, we have six weeks I think. Just for writing this, so just the two first parts would take a really long time and it's already a scientific article to, to go through the literature and see about social affordances, which ones promote social presence and which one not. So I think, it's, this is already an article.",CON,P,SA2 11.12,
V,Mhm.,QC,P,SA2 11.12,
B,"And if we want, if we want to, if we want to go through and the analysis of Teams, I think we should all reduce the first part or directly leave it, because I would say it's really, really broad.",EXT,P,SA2 11.12,
S,"Well, something to think about, exactly! 'cause, by the way, just just so we're clear, let's be honest, they, they were very vague and kind of, pardon my friends, BSING, about write a scientific article, but they, they, let's let's put it this way, we weren't, the facilitation of this of the outcome that works, that deliverable that we're supposed to do was not very well described initially.",EXT,OT,SA2 11.12,
V,No.,QC,OT,SA2 11.12,
S,"And as my classmate like just like to say, you know what you, they get the output from the input they get.",EXT,OT,SA2 11.12,
V,"Mhm, yes. ",QC,OT,SA2 11.12,
S,"So I think we'll do fine. We're narrowing down our focus, but without emphasizing the externalized locus of control, let's be honest, they could have done a bit better.",EXT,OT,SA2 11.12,
V,"Yeah, yeah, definitely. I mean, as I said, we asked for the formalities before just like, like formalities, does like I think that they just said OK just you know, write whatever. They're like, they said their words were create a scientific article, but what I took from that was just choose something that you're interested in, find references to back you up and write it. Like, I don't think we have to lose so much time in trying to be, you know scientific and yes, we have to look do it right, we have to have the references we have to make, make a lot of inquiries and gather a lot of information, but we can, you know, be flexible in that aspect. OK, so I think we narrow it down. Sorry, S?",QC,F,SA2 11.12,
S,"Yes, so we narrowed it down and or do you thinking about the next?",ELI,F,SA2 11.12,
O,"OK, uh, I don't know if, uh, we're looking at another meaning of it, but from what I have here, I just typed to ask Google and it says it refers to the property of an of an object or environment that permits social  (inaudible) of the teams, we, by social affordances, by social affordance, of affordances, of the team, we mean it's property, the property that, that the team has, a learning environment possess that enables social interaction. I mean, it's, it's a,  It's a learning environment and online learning environment from definition here. Or maybe if it's something different from this, but from what I can read here then we are looking at what properties does Teams have that offer us and it's a good background for social interaction, so it's for social actions so I don't think it's something big. It's, it's not already, I mean what, what else can we narrow it to, how, I don't know, but I'm just asking.",ELI,,SA2 11.12,
V,"So, by the term of social affordances we can, for example, include also what you said, relationships we need to, we need to talk about social emotional processes of, of the students, so like, like at at the how much, at what, extent the, the CSCL environment promotes social affordances. It can be, you know, you can touch so many subjects, so like so many. ",QC,,SA2 11.12,
B,"I honestly think that we this week we should read more about social affordances, about social presence and when we have a clearer idea, I'm sure the question will come because right now we are trying to think about a question without knowing very well the definition, so let's work on it, Let's write in the padlet some ideas and we can keep on talking about this next week. I think, right, because I think it's better to have a clear definition in mind than talking without knowing very well how it goes.",EXT,F,SA2 11.12,
V,"Yeah, and I think that maybe…",QC,F,SA2 11.12,
O, UUUUM!,EXT,,SA2 11.12,
V,…  we could do that with the research.,QC,,SA2 11.12,
O,"And while we are that, I think we can also think about like I, I said earlier, the topic, I mean the the umbrella topic for the article by trying to incorporate the, the, the, the term social affordances and the social, some other aspects we've actually analyzed, so maybe when someone has an idea we can come up with coining a topic.",EXT,F,SA2 11.12,
V,Mhm. ,QC,F,SA2 11.12,
O,"Does, I mean I think we need to have a topic. So even if we dissect every part of it and we do not have a general topic, then we haven't started yet. ",EXT,F,SA2 11.12,
B,"But the topic is Social presence in CSCL, so we have this topic, and apart from this you can start opening to social affordances, to what are really social affordances, because I'm sure it's an open term and we can go deep on it and this is already a topic I would say.",CON,F,SA2 11.12,
V,"Yeah, I agree. I would say that, I mean I, I agree with B like the question will come when we know more like at this point I don't know what else to say about social affordances, like I have to go read.  I cannot come up with any question, any problematic, nothing because I don't know enough. So for me it's really hard to say and to come up with with a very narrow down topic, 'cause I don't think neither of us have enough information to finish it, narrow it down. So I propose, I think following on what B said, to schedule a meeting for next time and by that point we read we try to read as much as we can, try to you know for ourselves and if we come up with ideas we have the Padlet. ",INT,F,SA2 11.12,
B,Yes.,QC,F,SA2 11.12,
V,"So, so we can, we can also comment on each other. I can see what you guys are thinking so maybe I could start building on your ideas, I think that's the best idea of having the, the Padlet.",EXT,F,SA2 11.12,
B,Yes.,QC,F,SA2 11.12,
V,"…  is that we can put our ideas out there and, and take from each other and read more.",EXT,F,SA2 11.12,
O,Yeah. ,QC,F,SA2 11.12,
V,"And then next time, next time we definitely need to have our research questions, so.",EXT,F,SA2 11.12,
B,"We will. I'm sure we will, because right now we just need to, to read to focus on. I'm sure it will come because right now we have ideas, that thing is that we have ideas, but we need to know how deep they are and if they are manageable or not.",EXT,P,SA2 11.12,

S, We don't know much about you so like where are you right now and what are you into?,ELI,OT,SA2 11.19,
A," So my name is A Diwari, I'm right now in India, I'm from India, I'm from computer science background. I have done my bacheIor specialization in information technology, yeah, and now in Master's in edutech.",EXT,OT,SA2 11.19,
V,"Alright, wow...nice.",QC,OT,SA2 11.19,
A,That's fantastic. (inaudible),QC,OT,SA2 11.19,
B,"Yes, and it's good to have another background because for Example V and me we are from Education and we don't have that knowledge in technology. So for this work, for  this article it would be interesting to see the opinions of someone from computer sciences I think.",INT,,SA2 11.19,
V, Yeah definetly,QC,,SA2 11.19,
A, Yeah.,QC,,SA2 11.19,
V, definely... ,QC,,SA2 11.19,
S,"Oh yeah. well, now we are all here.",EXT,F,SA2 11.19,
V,"Yep, let's get do it.",QC,F,SA2 11.19,
S,How much time should we dedicate?,ELI,F,SA2 11.19,
V," Well, maybe an hour? I need to have a class in one hour and twenty minutes precisely. So that's my target, like an hour and half.",QC,F,SA2 11.19,
B," Let's say one hour, and if not, we can make it longer but let's say one hour. ",INT,F,SA2 11.19,
V, Yeah like next week yeah at 10 I have another class so exactly one hour and twenty minutes.,INT,F,SA2 11.19,
B," Okay, umm do you want me to share the padlet or something that we can start talking from there or should we just talk about our ideas individually and try to...",ELI,F,SA2 11.19,
V," I think, I mean, did everybody, I've read what you guys, S and B wrote...",INT,P,SA2 11.19,
B, Yeah me too. ,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
V," ...so I know what you, I mean of course you can still talk, but I'm already aware of what is your thinking. ",INT,P,SA2 11.19,
B, Yes.,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
V,"A and O have you had time to read through what, because S and B have already proposed certain question and aim. I wrote what about theoretical staff. But did you have time to read about it?",ELI,P,SA2 11.19,
A,"actually from the last past two lectures I was absent… so I just wanted to hear idea about, I have an idea but just, what exactly we have to do?",ELI,P,SA2 11.19,
V," Yeah, but you mean what do we have to do in general or?",ELI,P,SA2 11.19,
A,Sorry?,ELI,,SA2 11.19,
V,Like what do we have to do in terms of us together like what are the instructions or?,ELI,P,SA2 11.19,
A, Yeah ,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
V," Okay, so...",EXT,,SA2 11.19,
A," Yeah, what we exactly (inaudible)",ELI,,SA2 11.19,
V," Okay, so, do you have access to the Teams?",ELI,P,SA2 11.19,
A, Yeah I have.,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
V,"Because in Teams you have the instruction, the collaborative phase, because we just finished this solo phase, and now we have collaborative phase where we have to create a scientific article. And we have 6 weeks altogether to come up with it and to write it and basically, last week and this week we were supposed to ah, we were supposed to create a question and set the aims like the topics of our research, so we can now start building it start thinking it and so on. ",EXT,P,SA2 11.19,
V, But we shared the link in the group like Step shared in WhatsApp group umm the takeaways of the meeting.,EXT,P,SA2 11.19,
A, Uh-huh,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
B," Yes and also...yeah. I was gonna just say that if you have questions, it's better if you ask them like in WhatsApp because we can answer you in that moment and then in the meeting we can be on the same page.  Because it's very difficult to dedicate this time to everything from the beggining so you can ask everything to us whenever you want and we will answer you, but let's try to be on the same page because if not we are going some people faster and some people slower and we need to go together, because if not, we won't time to finish the article.",EXT,P,SA2 11.19,
V, Ye. How about you O? Have you read what the guys wrote and what I wrote in the padlet?,ELI,P,SA2 11.19,
O, Okay I am just going to read it right now.,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
V, Okay,QC,,SA2 11.19,
O, I think (inaudible) how to (inaudible) some articles (inaudible)… but I went to a few things what (inaudible) and I just check that you mentioned it and I'm just going to,EXT,P,SA2 11.19,
V, Okay...,QC,,SA2 11.19,
B, Well...yeah we can just discuss about what we have because...umm,EXT,F,SA2 11.19,
V," Yeah I think that you guys have very like, your questions are quite similar. S is more narroword and B is a little bit more open.",EXT,P,SA2 11.19,
B, Yeah,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
V," So still we could narrow it down potentially, but I think that that's the main difference among you guys although however I feel like you went to get to the kind of the same topic.",EXT,P,SA2 11.19,
B," Yes yes, when I saw S's question, I saw like it was perfectly defined. I tried to find the information about it, so when I wrote my question, it was because I didn't find anything related with Teams. But just after, I found some articles related with analysis of Teams, so it was really really interesting. So I think that there is something we can work in, you know, there is some is some background and information that is still there.",INT,P,SA2 11.19,
V, yeah,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
B, So I will be super down for S's idea.,EXT,P,SA2 11.19,
V,"Yeah good. I liked it as well. For me, I liked more, I always like more like kind of this sociological part like this social aspect of, so I went to look what are social affordances.",INT,P,SA2 11.19,
V," And it took me a really long time because there were so many ways like the ecological approach, the constructivist approach, there is so many ways of defining it. So I think that regardless of the topic, we need to like for example, in the theoretical framework we need to address the issues of defining. Before we even narrow it to Teams, we need to go, I think, into how different people define it and what are we can define it. Like okay, this is how researchers define social affordances from many different points, and this is the way we gonna focus. I kind of try to find different definitions and different ways to look at the definition of social presence as well.",EXT,P,SA2 11.19,
B, Yeah.,QC,,SA2 11.19,
S, It seems that there are at least three different points or reference to analyse social affordances.,INT,,SA2 11.19,
V, Uh-huh.,QC,,SA2 11.19,
S, There's like at least from what we gathered.,INT,,SA2 11.19,
V," The least, yeah.",QC,,SA2 11.19,
S," So just, to be honest, just a question of which is more appropreate to analyse umm, it's already a, another and more theoretical question.",INT,,SA2 11.19,
B," Yeah, it could be interesting to compare them and to see what the definition address or what each definition focus on, so this is start of the theoretical framework but we can see what they try to highlight in each definition.",INT,,SA2 11.19,
V, Yeah definetly.,QC,,SA2 11.19,
B," Yeah, and also S, I was gonna ask you if you can explain about the honeycomb because I didn't understand very well the picture so if you as you read the article maybe you can.",ELI,,SA2 11.19,
S," Yes, it's based, it's umm, it was used in the the girl's name...PhD supervisor...sss Sabrine!",QC,,SA2 11.19,
V, Okay Sabrine ah yeah yeah.,QC,,SA2 11.19,
S, So she sared an article where they used three widgets and Moodles and the choice of the widgets was justified by using social networking and honey comb.,EXT,,SA2 11.19,
S," This is actually a good example that there is no framework for specifically, at least none that I found, that takes look at social affordance through synchronous computer media communication or video conference tool. ",EXT,,SA2 11.19,
V, Umm,QC,,SA2 11.19,
S," So that's actually, this honeycomb is really for social media, lke facebook etc. and yep. So yeah, matters such as identity groups...some are really unfamilier I was like okay, but that's I found this two honeycombs were on the one on the right elaborated a bit more.",EXT,,SA2 11.19,
V, Umm,QC,,SA2 11.19,
S, So basically it's just a framework but it's actually used in socialmedia.,EXT,,SA2 11.19,
V, Umm,QC,,SA2 11.19,
S, That's why harder to connect to like a Teams for example. But...,EXT,,SA2 11.19,
V, Yes yes definetely...,QC,,SA2 11.19,
S," But again just a kind a staying on being more academic, you know basing on someone else's work rather than...",EXT,,SA2 11.19,
B," Yes, it could be, I liked the idea of basing our analysis on some previous modeI or something like that, but I see this honeycomb is more relIated to social media and Teams so it's kind of difficult to analyse our social affordances, I mean social affordances in Teams with this honeycomb. I don't know. Maybe we can.....",INT,P,SA2 11.19,
S,,EXT,,SA2 11.19,
V," Yes, let me check...",QC,P,SA2 11.19,
B," we have...(inaudible)...way to analyse it...maybe we can even ask to the teacher. I mean, I'm sure umm Kreijns? I don't know how to pronounce it, but teacher in Netherlands, maybe he has a way to...to... more to analyse this kind of stuff and",EXT,P,SA2 11.19,
S, So speaking up,EXT,,SA2 11.19,
O, Um... ,EXT,,SA2 11.19,
O," Um...from what I can see from what you just explained, I think it doesn't necessary get it's not restricted to just social media, I mean, from the different points or different aspects of it, it's more or less exactly the same thing that applicable to the Teams, ",INT,,SA2 11.19,
O," ...and regardless of each proposed, I think it's somehow umm connects to everything (inaudible) Teams and all of the... I mean I was able to read few things from what she just showord and...I think it's a good (inaudible) to use to. The fact that it's very social media, it doesn't really make...much difference.",INT,,SA2 11.19,
S, So that's...,EXT,,SA2 11.19,
V, S are you sharing right?,ELI,,SA2 11.19,
S," Yes yes. Um I'm just looking for the other set of criteria reIated to communication. And this one is over ninety six...I'm pretty sure, a really good article. Forgot already.",EXT,,SA2 11.19,
O, I...,EXT,,SA2 11.19,
V, Umm I don't know.,EXT,,SA2 11.19,
S," Yeah (inaudible) and (inaudible) I mean, just to say thank you because it's a good one.",EXT,,SA2 11.19,
O," Yeah, I found it somewhere online.",QC,,SA2 11.19,
S," Yeah, that's a good another, actually this one is really related like more reIevant to synchronized, F no acutally not even synchronized, can you, CMC co-presense (inaudible)... So really if you, if you have to look at Teams specifically, this set of criteria is much more focused on that.",EXT,,SA2 11.19,
V," Yeah, I think it's good to have a quite simple frame of reference or like framework through which we can analyse because then our analysis therefore is much easier and...",INT,,SA2 11.19,
S," But in terms of, that's the tricky part like this one is more let's say appropreate for Teams, but that honeycomb kinda touches on the social presense aspect.",CON,,SA2 11.19,
V," Yeah, let me, can I, I will take another look at honeycomb. Let's see.",EXT,F,SA2 11.19,
S," Because it's that idea of, okay, presence what creating managing reality, intimacy, medacy context, so abstract, so you really gotta read that whole article to .",CON,,SA2 11.19,
B," Umm I uploaded an article analysing platforms like Teams and I didn't have time to go really through it, but I'm gonna see how they analysed Teams because, I mean which framework.",EXT,F,SA2 11.19,
S,"Ahh, they used the, yeah the Danish people.",QC,,SA2 11.19,
V, Uh-huh,QC,,SA2 11.19,
S,"Potentially the main, the main work, main paper that we can get inspired how to frame ours. Zoom, Teams and xxx  They use the xxx grounding on ontrogical ethics of",EXT,,SA2 11.19,
S, ...and theory of recognition of honest.,EXT,,SA2 11.19,
V, That's so funny....ahhh.,EXT,,SA2 11.19,
S, Which speaking of like more sociological take,EXT,,SA2 11.19,
V," Yeah, yes.",QC,,SA2 11.19,
S, this one things umm....,EXT,,SA2 11.19,
V," Yes. I think the honeycomb idea it's, it's, it could be cool. It could be I mean, also I mean it doesn't like if we air, like if we let's say we find out that it's not at the end we are biased or our kind of the ideas that we put forward are not so applicable...sorry my hair looks crazy guys  Then, we can just you know, mention it we learners we go we are not supposed to present perfect work as so far as we learn so...and it's innovative.",EXT,,SA2 11.19,
B," Yeah, it could be even interesting to say that we were interested in using honeycomb that, it's more for social media aspect, but we wanted to see how close it was with our Platform. And we can lead analysis saying that although it's for social media we can or we cannot use it for this.",INT,P,SA2 11.19,
V, Yeah exactly exactly!,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
B, So it's another path in the research it's also interesting.,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
V," Yeah, yeah. And we so put like at the end in the discussion part like reflect on our tools that we used like did it work F we changed F proposed some adjustments F things that we would leave out F we could focus more. I think it's also part of good reflection at the end.",INT,P,SA2 11.19,
B," Yeah, yeah. I really liked the questions you wrote S, I really liked the research question.",EXT,P,SA2 11.19,
S, Thank you.,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
V," Yeah definetely, I liked it, too.",QC,P,SA2 11.19,
S," It's, and it's relevant as you know the whole, I was shocked myseIf when I found out how many kids are using Teams.",EXT,,SA2 11.19,
V, Umm,QC,,SA2 11.19,
S," I thoght it's just adult education, higher education, but then it's like my Colombian classmate said that his 1st grade nephew, (inaudible) of course that basically cost as much as my... oh anyway you know, they are already masters of Teams, 1st graders master of Teams.",EXT,,SA2 11.19,
V," Yeah Teams, yeah.",QC,,SA2 11.19,
S," Oh yeah, so in terms of relevance, it's, I know it's something when I started (inaudible) I did not acknowledge its relevance. And now having gone through it of getting used to Teams, which is clumsy, clanky...",EXT,,SA2 11.19,
V, Yeah.,QC,,SA2 11.19,
S, But it's all-in-one.,EXT,,SA2 11.19,
S," Anyway, just a kinda sum up on these three criteria, so these are really for source of our research so far. Honeycomb, ",EXT,P,SA2 11.19,
V, Yeah,QC,,SA2 11.19,
S," it was used for mostly social media, then the 96 communication channel, criteria for communication channels, and that one is from Danish (inaudible) Honest structure relations, so.",EXT,P,SA2 11.19,
V," Yeah....yeah, thank you, I was losing my sight. Umm...I like this.",EXT,,SA2 11.19,
B, Uh-huh.,QC,,SA2 11.19,
B," But I would say there are so many, umm, things to address. Maybe we don't have, we don't find how to answer each one with Teams, you know, maybe there's no answer for some of them.",CON,P,SA2 11.19,
V, Uh-huh...ummm,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
S," Well, that would be part of our critical expression",CON,P,SA2 11.19,
B," Yes, yes ",QC,P,SA2 11.19,
V," Exactly, yeah.",QC,P,SA2 11.19,
B," That's true, that's true yeah yeah.",QC,P,SA2 11.19,

V, Yeah...,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
S, At least now we have a good selection.,EXT,P,SA2 11.19,
B, Yes,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
V," Yeah...I...I really liked...also we, I mean, we can still, we can focus on a one, but maybe we can bring aspects whichever aspects we can find from the...",INT,P,SA2 11.19,
B," Yes, and we can even compare like justification of why did we choose these criteria method, we can justify why this one, and what is the difference between other ones...",INT,P,SA2 11.19,
V, Umm ,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
B, ....you know like trying to analyse also this part because we can analyse which method should be like a good one plus why it's that one not others.,INT,P,SA2 11.19,
V," Yeah...yeah. Ah...the more I look at this honeycomb thing, I like it.",EXT,,SA2 11.19,

V," We talk about social affordances, social presence, sociability of CSCL environments and we have quoted some definitions on the Padlet, so I think that we are on the same page, so maybe we can start thinking and, and start moving forward to the next page, the next module.",EXT,P,SA2 11.19,
B, Yeah.,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
V,if you guys agree.,ELI,P,SA2 11.19,
B, Yes.,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
V, I don't whatever you want.,EXT,P,SA2 11.19,
A, We also...,EXT,p,SA2 11.19,
B,"Yes,  I think we should also write the our topic. Ooops, sorry.",EXT,P,SA2 11.19,
V," A, was saying something.",ELI,,SA2 11.19,
A, Mhm. ,QC,,SA2 11.19,

V, Ah.,QC,,SA2 11.19,
A, Yeah. ,QC,,SA2 11.19,
B," OK, I, I was just gonna say, that maybe we should, UM, show this, this research question, to, to the teacher... ",EXT,P,SA2 11.19,
V,  Y+B256es.,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
B,and to to see if we are well in that way or not.,EXT,P,SA2 11.19,
V, Yeah. So we can drop a message.,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
B," What, O, what?",ELI,,SA2 11.19,
O," We, we need to, we need to pick up, pick a few out of, I mean, I think it’s UM, S, who posted in research question?",ELI,P,SA2 11.19,
V, B.,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
O,Let's just decide and then pick something and get them organized. Then ask if they're OK.,EXT,P,SA2 11.19,
V," I think we pretty much, I mean, I thought that we agreed on teams. I think, B said that In teams would be nice so ... Like both their questions are very similar so we can try to do it in teams.",CON,P,SA2 11.19,
O,,,,SA2 11.19,
V, I think I understood that's what we agreed.,CON,P,SA2 11.19,
O," Yeah.  I understand, but what I am saying, since both questions are similar, we could just decide on the final question from what they post already, put them together in, in a more comprehensive way and fold it.",CON,P,SA2 11.19,
A, Mhm. ,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
B," But, but, I, I agree. I agree that it's better to take S’s idea because it's already very close to mine and if we miss them. ",CON,P,SA2 11.19,
V, Mhm.,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
B,"maybe, it's gonna be too, too open to do it. Like...",CON,P,SA2 11.19,
V, Yeah.,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
B," I was, I was saying to analyze like social affordances but with another, aaam perspective, but it's true that if we open it in that way and then analyze teams, it's going to be too much, so it's better to have like a very focused question that all of us understand and we can work on it, like with this goal in mind, that it's this question. ",INT,P,SA2 11.19,
V," Mhm.  Plus, I think that if, like, anyhow, uh, what are the social affordances that have a great, greatest impact in CSCL on CSCL environments, I,  I think that that question will for sure be answered within theory because it's it's it's broad. Perhaps we won't be to the greatest, but we will answer it at some point in our theoretical framework and analysis because it's super inter-related to the social affordances of the teams so we have to understand which of the social affordances have an impact on CSCL environment, so I feel like it will be answered.",INT,P,SA2 11.19,
B," Yeah, yeah, it's true that my question was like more focused on analyzing what are the types of social affordances...",INT,P,SA2 11.19,
V, Mhm.,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
B,and to see like in all the platforms not only...,INT,P,SA2 11.19,
V,Yeah. ,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
B,"like just to see which one, which ones are right now in, in the market and then to",INT,P,SA2 11.19,
V, Mhm.,QC,P,SA2 11.19,
B,"say which ones have like better resource or bad/greater impact. But anyway, I I really like the the other questions, so it's fine. ",INT,P,SA2 11.19,
S," Speaking of which, like, I actually have an answer for you which platform. ",EXT,,SA2 11.19,
B, Which platform?,ELI,,SA2 11.19,

B, Oh yeaaaah? ,ELI,,SA2 11.19,
S,"Exactly. It's this. They are in a better state, they might will launch. It's still free, just to give you a sense. Like literally, 40 - 30 seconds overview. So, this is just the landing page.

B,"First, send a question to the teachers.",EXT,F,SA2 11.19,
V,"Check, yeah. How do you want to do that? Should we just reply in teams and say: “Hey, can you take a look at our document?”",ELI,F,SA2 11.19,
B," Yeah I would, I would…",QC,F,SA2 11.19,
A,,,,SA2 11.19,
B,"Maybe we can, hmhm…OK, because the document, maybe is not clear enough, so maybe we can just write in a comment our questions. The thing you wrote, S, in your square.",CON,F,SA2 11.19,
V," Yeah, I did.",QC,,SA2 11.19,
B,"Uh, in, in a comment in teams because maybe it's gonna be easier for them to go directly and you can tag them.",INT,F,SA2 11.19,
S, .,,F,SA2 11.19,
B," I would tag the tutor and the teacher right, Sabine and Karel.",INT,F,SA2 11.19,
V," Alright, alright.",QC,F,SA2 11.19,
A, Mhm.,QC,F,SA2 11.19,

B," OK I will. OK, I will do it. Just when we finish the meeting.",EXT,F,SA2 11.19,
V," Yeah, yeah, no rush.",QC,F,SA2 11.19,
S," Then just a word of notice, that a, how you experience learning  collaborative learning in teams is highly dependent on exactly the widgets that are available.",EXT,,SA2 11.19,
A, Mhm. ,QC,,SA2 11.19,
S," Now, there’s actually, see my God, there's actually different levels of how cool teams can be. We are basically at the, the least engaging level. ",EXT,,SA2 11.19,
V," engaging, mhm.",EXT,,SA2 11.19,
S,"  The highest, so higher would be create your own teams, you have more ownership, you know, edit whatever. and your own, and so that's one, next level is when the company pays fF all these widgets because they do have, like EMOTIONAL AWARENESS awareness widgets.",EXT,,SA2 11.19,
V," Oh, I didn't know that!",QC,,SA2 11.19,
S,"They introduced them last autumn. Again it's paid, so I just know that it's there, but… ",EXT,,SA2 11.19,
V," But you cannot do, maaan…",EXT,,SA2 11.19,
B,,,,SA2 11.19,
S," OK, so that's the, so again, if we talk about Teams, we'll have to very specify that it's experienced through free, like in its bare form.",EXT,,SA2 11.19,
V, Form? Yeah.,ELI,,SA2 11.19,
B, Yeah yeah.,QC,,SA2 11.19,
V,"Although, I mean this what you said emotional awareness, but I think that it's interesting to point out that the widgets are there, in the province, something else…",INT,,SA2 11.19,
B, Yeah.,QC,,SA2 11.19,
V,"But you know, we don't have to go… so broad because then it will take us ages, but I think that these things, like you found, that eventhough it's not for free, they, like the widgets are there like, the Teams can provide it, but, but the same as everything… In zoom is the same. You want meeting longer than 40 minutes - Pay.",CON,,SA2 11.19,
V,You know…,EXT,,SA2 11.19,
A,"Yeah, yeah.",QC,,SA2 11.19,
V," …it's, they have the basic and then what can come after, and I think that we could also analyze those briefly, like what extras could promote social presence. What kind of this extra social affordances could, could potentially promote it. I think that maybe, it could be interesting to, to look at those stuff as well.",EXT,,SA2 11.19,
B," Yeah, it's true that I would leave this step depending on the time we have and how we will.",INT,,SA2 11.19,
V,Mhm .,QC,,SA2 11.19,
B,"How we see we go, because it's true that this like, providing new ideas of affordances that could work… it's much work. I mean, we have to work more on that, and if we want to go deep on it, we have to have time for that. So, we should just go to the analysis and then if we see we have time, I… ",INT,,SA2 11.19,
V, We’ll do it do it.,QC,,SA2 11.19,
B,would go and do that. ,INT,,SA2 11.19,
V," Yeah, cool.",QC,,SA2 11.19,
S, Sounds good.,QC,,SA2 11.19,
V," Cool, cool, cool. So personally, I think that I have to before next meeting I would like to, personally, research more on teams…",EXT,F,SA2 11.19,
B,  Me too. ,QC,F,SA2 11.19,
V,"  …touch more everything, 'cause, this is still quite new to me, so I think I need to master it as much as I can. And also I see that you shared the video, B. I haven't seen it yet, but I will, uh, so that's what I'm gonna do.",EXT,F,SA2 11.19,
B, .,,F,SA2 11.19,
S, It’s the same name guys that wrote that article about…,EXT,,SA2 11.19,
B," Yeah, I saw, I saw, haha, but maybe I, weIl, I I saw the video up for me what’s interesting maybe we can just try to see it. And if we like it, we can go through the article or not. I went through the article, but, so it's more about ethical part than about a, other type of analysis, but it's fine. Just to have an idea. Yeah.",EXT,P,SA2 11.19,
S," I think video is great, especially in case you're kind of cooking or doing something and you can put it in the background and study.",INT,,SA2 11.19,
V, Put it… hehe.,EXT,,SA2 11.19,
B, Yeah.,QC,,SA2 11.19,

But I'm, I'm taking vitamin D, as well, vitamin, vitamin D, and vitamin C, but for me I don't…. I, I took this test, this blood test a couple months ago and I was lacking vitamin D and then I took it again just a week ago and it was the same, even though I'm taking these pills like, these pills, these vitamins everyday, so I'm like, I don't know, I now, I'm taking them whenever I remember.",EXT,OT,SA2 11.25,

V,Mhm ,QC,,SA2 11.25,
S,"… this ended up being the most simple, clear, hassle free.",EXT,,SA2 11.25,

V,"So, basically cover page, abstract, abstract, keywords, then that we can leave by the end, at the very end.",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
B,Yes. ,QC,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"Uhm, introduction and literature review. Basically, like the theoretical framework, then methodology, analysis and result, discussion and limitations and recommendations, recommendation for future research. ",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
B,"Yeah. Puh, I feel this is too difficult to divide. You know, it's like. If we, one person, I mean for me, when I have written articles, it's much easier to do it by myself, because you are building your knowledge and when you are working with many people in the same introduction, I don't know how to, how could we do it.",CON,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"I, yeah, that is, for example, for the introdu-, the, the, the introduction, which is mostly theory, I think there's like, we have clear concepts that we already defined before. I think like we need to have clearly list of the topic that we have. We have to, in my opinion, we have to first talk about social presence, social affordances, these concepts. Sociability of CSCL environments, concepts how these links to each other and then bring up Teams and present a question. So, I think that, that if we set up at like, the list of topics that we have to talk, then I can say OK, I, I go through the definition of social presence, you can B help for example with the definition of social affordances..",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
B,Mhm.  ,QC,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"…and so on. So we can, we sort of have a continuity of, of ideas, because if we, each of us write separately and then we put them together, it doesn't make sense like it does… It won't add up. We all write in different styles. We will all look at different topics so…",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
B,Yeah.,QC,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"I think that we have as much as we can together, or agree, as in the very little details, so we can, you know  have actually a collaborative group, not… ",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
O,"You mean it's, it's not possible to share it into sections like maybe one person does introduction the other literature review, review and then methodology for the other?",ELI,F,SA2 11.25,
B,"No, because it doesn't have any sense that someone is start writing about methodology…",CON,F,SA2 11.25,
V,Mhm. ,QC,F,SA2 11.25,
B,"If we don't have a clear introduction like common introduction, I mean I feel it's very difficult to go into methods if you don't know the whole introduction.",CON,F,SA2 11.25,
O,"Ah, that’s correct. I think we should start with the introduction and the UM literature review. Then at the end of that we can proceed to methodology.",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"Yeah, but we have to remember that we have this week and next week.",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
O,Only?,ELI,F,SA2 11.25,
B,Yeah. ,QC,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"Like we basically have, that's what the, the, the, the schedule says that we should have most of the writing done within this week and next week and then we move into abstract and so on. We may, we can, you know, push it and push it to the other week. But the idea is to, I mean that's their schedule. We can still work on our schedule, which I think that we will need the extra week, definitely. ",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
O,OK.,QC,F,SA2 11.25,
S,I hope…,EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
O,"I think we should look at the, the articles we have already and check if they are not for, what we could do for the introduction and the literature review. And if they are not, then we source for more and put them together, select what we're going to work on and read them individually, then maybe write it just like we do have a centralized platform.  Sorry… Page we opened already in the Files that we all can be writing, so as I am writing, I'm dropping mine, someone else is writing and then we can, follow up from one to the other. But again, we have to by… Maybe if we can't share the sections, then I think we can share the variables. ",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
V,What do you mean by variables? ,ELI,F,SA2 11.25,
O,"For example, yeah. the desirable is the independent and dependent variables in the (inaudible) is like affordances, social presence and all of that.",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"I'm, I wouldn’t get, having a how, I was not considering this independent and dependent variable, because this is a literature review, basically a literature thesis. ",CON,F,SA2 11.25,
O," Is it not considerable what, what is dependent or independent, independent? I'm just talking about the different. OK, how do I put it apart from using the word variables?",ELI,F,SA2 11.25,
B,"That what we must include, right, the concept of social affordances, social aspects, yeah.",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
O,"Yeah, exactly. That's the other way.",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"Yeah, related to that, I think I mean personally we put in Padlet, like we put in Padlet many articles. Like I've shared articles as well. So for me I don't need to, like if you ask me what I, I could probably write,  I could tell you right now which authors what would I want to quote.",CON,F,SA2 11.25,
O,Mhm.,QC,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"Yeah, I already put in Padlet like three diff-, three different, different definitions of social presence. So we could mention them and then say OK, this is the, the definition that we could talk, which is basically the degree of silence of the other one and the further interaction so. So, I think that that will be going back in time because that should like, that is, that is done already, I think.",CON,F,SA2 11.25,
B,Yeah.,QC,F,SA2 11.25,
S,"Uhm, let's, why don't we agree on those, main concepts. Then it's a good, really good point. As I had some of my own, but then listening, to me like it's, hm, good. We do need to discuss this together.",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
B,"Yeah, I think we should discuss that, the, the, the concepts we want to, include in the introduction.",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
V,Uhm. ,QC,F,SA2 11.25,
B,"Pff, and, and we should start like writing this concepts as we want to show in the introduction. Of course, then we, we will make changes, but as we only have two weeks, it's crazy how much do we have to do so. ",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"S, it looks like you had already something in mind like, uh, you, can you share? Like, what do you have in mind?",ELI,P,SA2 11.25,
S,"Yes, I am, one sec... First of all brief, a description of I don't know online learning or specifically computer mediated communication.",EXT,P,SA2 11.25,
V,Mhm.,QC,,SA2 11.25,
B,Mhm. ,QC,,SA2 11.25,
S,"Yeah, 'cause, yeah so, so one. Generally, this online whatever remote communication, just one, then affordances. Question, do we even need to mention that?",ELI,,SA2 11.25,
V,Yes. ,QC,,SA2 11.25,
S,"OK, see. In that case. ",QC,,SA2 11.25,
O,Do we really need to mention that?,ELI,,SA2 11.25,
V,"I would link it with the possibility of sociability, like I would bring sociability of the, of the online learning environments and then the affordances.",INT,,SA2 11.25,
S,Yes.,QC,,SA2 11.25,
B,Yeah.,QC,,SA2 11.25,
S,"Sociability is made up of, social affordances make up sociability. ",QC,,SA2 11.25,
V, Exactly.,QC,,SA2 11.25,

V,Mhm. ,QC,,SA2 11.25,
V,Yeah.,QC,,SA2 11.25,
B,"You mean to talk about the affordances in itself and not social affordances before, right?",ELI,,SA2 11.25,
S,"Well, that's the ques- question, do you think it's…? ",ELI,,SA2 11.25,
B,"Yeah, I would say, I would say that we can go directly to social affordances and when you give the definition, you can mention affordances. But I wouldn't start defining affordances itself without mentioning before social affordances, because but it will depends on how we write it, it's.",CON,,SA2 11.25,
O,"I think writing about social affordances covers it all. We don't really have to. I mean, we don't need something too lengthy and with numerous chapters, so I think defining it means social affordances on its own covers the affordances definition and not segregating it, especially at the point of writing about on the background, sorry, introduction to the studies to social affordances, covers affordances and all of that.",QC,,SA2 11.25,
V,"Yes, so I would, I would like to talk about affordances, the term, but it's really broad so I wouldn't go in there. I like the term because it has a lot of research done as well.",CON,,SA2 11.25,
B,Yeah. ,QC,,SA2 11.25,
V,"And just the term affordances, but this is not our deal. Better to focus on like, I would particularly jump from online learning to social presence, sociability and social affordances.",CON,,SA2 11.25,
B,Yeah me too.,QC,,SA2 11.25,
S,"Cool, so I agree that we can if we, if we feel, if I, don't, you're inspired, you can connect it, but it's not the same. You know, essential. Good, question answered. Next. The actual framework for analysis.",CON,P,SA2 11.25,
V,Yes.,QC,,SA2 11.25,

B,Sorry. ,EXT,,SA2 11.25,
V,"In the beginning, I would say. ",EXT,,SA2 11.25,
B,"Because if we are gonna mention it from the beginning, we can give an introduction saying that we will explain the main concept on what is the relationship of all this with Microsoft Teams or why did we choose that. Or you know, like a justification of why are we doing this.",INT,,SA2 11.25,
B," I don't know if, before or after the definitions of the concepts. ",ELI,,SA2 11.25,
V,"I would put it after. Like, OK in this situation we, what we already know. We aim to look at this and, and, and explain how, like the methodology briefly.",EXT,,SA2 11.25,
B,Mhm.,QC,,SA2 11.25,
V,"Like, not, not explaining because it will, like it's an introduction so. And as… ",EXT,,SA2 11.25,
O,"I, I really have one more question from the concept we have online learning and are we really looking broadly at generally online learning or CSCL collaboration or collaborative learning on online setting? Because if we are looking at that, then it's missing in here.",ELI,,SA2 11.25,
V,"I wouldn't say that we focus on collaborative learning, per se, I would say we would look more at computer mediated, like, CMC.",CON,,SA2 11.25,
B,Yeah. ,QC,,SA2 11.25,
V,But that's my opinion guys. I don't know what you think.,ELI,,SA2 11.25,
S,"I would say since, yes.",QC,,SA2 11.25,
S,"…because CSCL has its own constructs and criteria, and we have not delved into those. Whereas what we are discussing could be equally, to think of applicability, both in the corporate context or educational one, you could apply the same idea, so…",EXT,,SA2 11.25,
O,"MY IDEA, I was thinking we could narrow it to CSCL since everything is about collaboration in CSCL,  so narrowing it down to CSCL, we, be more specific than having to deal with the whole computer mediated collaboration stuff, because I mean our target just as the, the courses is a collaborative CSCL.",EXT,,SA2 11.25,
V,"Yeah, I agree. But, but, like this is not even our point, because we will look at social affordances whether we use the like computer mediated like, whether it's in collaborative work, I think we've just focused more now on online learning.",CON,,SA2 11.25,
B,Yeah. ,QC,,SA2 11.25,
V,"An online learning can be collaborative or not, like it can take many forms. So I think that we're looking at how Teams, a work, as how Teams provide social affordances, the, the extent to which we can interact and so on. So, it, we don't really focus about CSCL, I don't think we do. Like…",CON,,SA2 11.25,
B,"Yeah, I agree. I think our topic it's more about social affordances, social presence. Well, we have to explain our, the framework we are going to use to analyze Microsoft Teams. But, the thing is that the computer media, collaborated, online learning and all that can be part of the introduction, but it's not our point. We have to say that we are using within that, write nowadays online learning is becoming more popular, blah, blah, blah, you can find references about that saying the importance of online learning. OK and then we say so an online learning. We have to check what is the social presence, I don't know, we have, we have, we can connect both terms, but the point is not to define online learning, going deep, you know online learning. The point is going directly to social presence, I'm going deeper there. I would say.",CON,,SA2 11.25,
V,Yes.,QC,,SA2 11.25,
S,"And specifically, computer mediated communication is actually, you'd be shocked there isn't like such abundance of impressive research. As you know, there's different terms and actually part of my thesis will be to include synchronous computer mediated communication, so I can confirm it's nice trend.

B,"Yeah. So good, we have the concept we want in the introduction. That's fine. It's good that we have the idea of what we want to talk there, so what should we do? Do we divide the terms? Do we? Because I think if we go everyone through all of them is not gonna be worth it because we have to, we have too much information there so.",ELI,P,SA2 11.25,
V,"B, we didn't agree at the end or maybe did we agree, but I did not get it. The question do we present it at the end or at the beginning? I suggest at the end, but we, I don't think we agree on that.",INT,P,SA2 11.25,
O,At the end.,EXT,P,SA2 11.25,
B,"Now, well here in the article structure that they gave us, he says that in the introduction and literature review we have to include what is the paper about.  ",CON,P,SA2 11.25,
V,Mhm.,QC,,SA2 11.25,
B,"So maybe we don't have to give the question, but we can say what is the paper about, then it says defining problem and the purpose of the study, then main theories and concepts and then the research questions and hypothesis. ",CON,P,SA2 11.25,
V,"Ok, so…",QC,,SA2 11.25,
B,"Maybe we have we have to like mix both parts, you know because if we have, if we want to include the research question in the,  at the end, we need to make reference of what is our study about in the beginning. ",INT,,SA2 11.25,
V,"I see. So then maybe, maybe we can see at the beginning is online learning and the importance of online learning. We can just swoop it in and say we're gonna look at how Teams, like briefly, we don't have to explain the whole thing. So, and then we can say, in order to analyze this, we need to have some concept strategy beforehand.",INT,,SA2 11.25,
B,Yeah. ,QC,,SA2 11.25,
V,"So then we explain and then we can maybe bring it back at the end, saying this is the way we're going to analyze it. Maybe mentioning briefly Methodology or something.",INT,,SA2 11.25,
B,"Yeah, in methodology, I think we should refer to our framework that we were gonna use to, use, The Honeycomb in the end, right? We should mention it, I think. Because, I wouldn't mention The Honeycomb definition in the introduction. ",ELI,,SA2 11.25,
V,"No, no.",CON,,SA2 11.25,
B,I would just go for it.,EXT,,SA2 11.25,
V,"We can go to methodology, like in methodology. Uhm, so maybe… To answer to your question before B. Maybe we can just, kind of, for example, divide it for example. I can talk about online learning and present the social presence and then like…",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
O,(inaudible) I'd like to find a lot about it.,EXT,,SA2 11.25,
V,So…,EXT,,SA2 11.25,
O,"So, I'll kick to talk about the Teams.",EXT,,SA2 11.25,
B,"What sorry, O, I couldn't listen you.",ELI,,SA2 11.25,
O,"Teams, MS Teams. ",EXT,,SA2 11.25,
B,"Ah, OK. ",QC,,SA2 11.25,
O,"At the end of it, OK? ",ELI,,SA2 11.25,
B,"The thing is that, if we are planning to meet next week on Thursday, for example, or on Friday or whatever, we should have more than this done. Because if, if I'm only for, for example, thinking about The Honeycomb method, it will be like a paragraph in the end. I mean I will read a lot, but I will write a paragraph because I, I, we, we wouldn't have, a paragraph or two paragraphs or whatever, but it's not really long. So I think we have much more to do. We can try to, to find more things, more information and then to talk about everything because. If not, I, I don't know if we will have time.",CON,F,SA2 11.25,
O,"I think (inaudible), we are writing on the introduction, we should at same time be of developing the literature review, because I, I mean most of the concepts we are going to mention in the introduction are the concepts we are going to review in the literature review.",EXT,,SA2 11.25,
V,"Mhm. Yeah, the introduction is just, we sweep it in, we explain it briefly, not briefly. We have to explain it enough that have a solid base.",EXT,,SA2 11.25,
B,Yeah. ,QC,,SA2 11.25,
V,"And because, I think that the main concept of the introduction and the theoretical kind of framework is that we recognize that there's a multiplicity of way of defining this concept, yet we choose this and that.",INT,,SA2 11.25,
B,Yeah. ,QC,,SA2 11.25,
V,"So, I, that's my, my idea, that's also the way I've been working on.",QC,,SA2 11.25,
B,"Yeah, I agree, I agree. And I also think that right now we are in the moment that it's not only about providing the info we find in the world. I mean, it's not about copying and paste. No, we just start. We have to start writing as if we were going to write an article only about the topic we are looking for. You know, for example, imagine that my topic right now is going to be, I don't know social affordances, so I'm gonna write and I'm, I'm gonna read 1st and then I'm gonna write like if I was writing an article about social affordances because it's important to go directly to write and not only to copy and paste, because we won't have time. So it's better to start writing.",EXT,P,SA2 11.25,
V,"Yeah, I agree.",QC,P,SA2 11.25,
S,"So ladies, I have to go. ",EXT,,SA2 11.25,
B,OK. ,QC,,SA2 11.25,
S,…Now. ,EXT,,SA2 11.25,
B,"Do you have any preferences or something, yeah? ",ELI,F,SA2 11.25,
S,You can just assign me.,EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"I was thinking, S, like the, you were very familiar with the Honeycomb framework, so maybe you can do methodology, like you can write about it. But I don't know, what…?",ELI,F,SA2 11.25,
S,"Yeah, like anything scientific, that anything, more scientific, trusting me with it, it's, it's a risk, but yeah, I'm, I'm down, I'm down.",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
B,Ok.,QC,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"Ok. Girls, can you stay a little bit longer so we can get?",ELI,,SA2 11.25,
B,Yes.,QC,,SA2 11.25,
V,Good.,QC,,SA2 11.25,
S,"So, yeah, continue writing in meeting notes, anything, especially for Anika if she wants to catch up and then, yeah, we'll do fine really. It's also, please, before I leave, for the observers, for just a moment, for the observers this is 2021 providing us with such a RIGID LINEAR PATH. To write an article is doesn't align with the values or the expectations we have as students in higher education 2021.

V,Yeah. ,QC,OT,SA2 11.25,
S,And also for us. ,EXT,OT,SA2 11.25,

S,"Yes, but when I leave I think it will be automatic.",QC,OT,SA2 11.25,
V,It will continue.,EXT,OT,SA2 11.25,

O,Bye. ,EXT,OT,SA2 11.25,
S,And stay in touch asynchronously. Ciao!,EXT,OT,SA2 11.25,
V,"Hmhm, bye. Tadatata, it looks like it's still recording. ",EXT,OT,SA2 11.25,
B,"OK, great.",QC,,SA2 11.25,
V,"OK, maybe two persons can work on the theoretical framework, like 2 persons, but like I think that we, like the two persons that work on the theoretical framework, have, have to talk not in as a group, but have to talk more.",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
B,"Yeah, I would suggest you and me actually, because I think, uh, yeah, I would suggest that because I think we can under-, we, we have a very, what I see, is that we have a very similar way too, right?",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
V,Mhm. ,QC,F,SA2 11.25,
B,Sooo… ,EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"Mmm, yeah. Uh, that's, that's OK. Yeah. I, I think that because we don't need like the whole group working on the theoretical framework, we just need, it's like the base like it has to be done and then we can move from there.",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
B,Yeah.,QC,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"So, let me check. Introduction, literature review, OK, research questions and hypothesis, OK. Methodology, then maybe, some methodology can be maybe…? ",ELI,F,SA2 11.25,
B,"I'm thinking because what, what would be including methodology? Like, how are we gonna do the analysis? Because this is something we haven't talked.",EXT,P,SA2 11.25,
V,Mmm.,QC,,SA2 11.25,
B,"I mean, we have just said that we are going to analyze Microsoft Teams, but we didn't say how. So…",CON,P,SA2 11.25,
V,But maybe… ,CON,,SA2 11.25,
O,"Like difficulty of these studies is the fact that we do not need to gather data from, maybe we do not need to really get the data and then do the analysis ourselves. So that is actually where the methodology is confusing for me, because I, I mean I'm aware of some kind of methodology for studies, but then I haven't actually have to do one that doesn't involve data analysis or data gathering and analysis.",EXT,,SA2 11.25,
V,"Mhm. Well, I think that the, the, the methodology that they provided doesn't add up with the literature review. ",CON,,SA2 11.25,
B,"No, it doesn't.",QC,,SA2 11.25,
V,I would say…,EXT,,SA2 11.25,
B," No, no, I would say that maybe we can ask if we should include this point, because if we are talking about and S is going to talk about The Honeycomb and everything, maybe we don't need to explain, we just need to say - OK, so, to analyze Microsoft Teams with Honeycomb we are just gonna go point, through point by point and analyzing that and we don't need to go that deep on this because we are not analyzing that data.",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
V,Exactly.,QC,F,SA2 11.25,
B,"So, I will leave this point like this because I would say that for the time we have they are not gonna ask for anything more in detail. But we need to, there is someone there is one person who has to write about other, research question what is, like the problem we want to address, uhm, you know, because here in Point C it says “constructing the solution for the problem question, construct the output where you provide answers for the question problem. I don't know what this refers because it's not very related to our topic, but maybe we have to include something with that. You know what I mean?",ELI,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"Yeah, I'm just. Where are you looking at? Because...",QC,P,SA2 11.25,
B,I'm gonna share my screen. ,EXT,P,SA2 11.25,
V,"… it is not in the article. Like I have it open right here, but it's not there.",QC,P,SA2 11.25,
B,"Wait, one second.",EXT,P,SA2 11.25,
V,"Maybe, I just don't see it.",EXT,P,SA2 11.25,
B,"OK, can you see my screen, please?",ELI,P,SA2 11.25,
V,Yes. ,QC,P,SA2 11.25,
B,"Yeah, I was referring to this. ",QC,P,SA2 11.25,
V,"Ahm, yeah we do… you provide answer.",QC,P,SA2 11.25,
B,"That's the point that I don't understand, because if we go to the general structure of the article, we are gonna do the introduction we are gonna do the methodology. But should we do the analysis? The analysis? I mean The Honeycomb and Microsoft Teams in these two weeks?",ELI,P,SA2 11.25,
V,Yes.,QC,P,SA2 11.25,
B,"OK, so, so maybe, maybe, uh, there must be two people working on that.",QC,P,SA2 11.25,
V,"So, how about? How, like, I think now you're sharing this",ELI,,SA2 11.25,
B,I'm gonna stop.,EXT,,SA2 11.25,
V,"Well, B left, oh, man! OK, should we wait O a little bit for her to come back? ",ELI,,SA2 11.25,
O,"Yeah, let’s just wait for her to come back. ",QC,,SA2 11.25,
B,"Sorry, I, I clicked the wrong button. ",QC,,SA2 11.25,
V,"Yeah, no, I saw, I saw. So maybe, I have an idea. ",QC,,SA2 11.25,
B,"Yeah, OK.",QC,,SA2 11.25,
V,"We work on the, the introduction, Basically the theoretical introduction where we introduce the concepts, then, then somebody focuses, says it specifically, this is the research question and this is what we're looking at. Then in methodology we can just explain how we're going to do it and then we have to narrow it down really low like we cannot do an analysis of four pages. This has to be using Honeycomb to analyze in qualitative form, Teams. Like we have to make it easier.",INT,F,SA2 11.25,
B,"Yeah, yeah, the thing is that the analysis is the most important part of our work.",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
V,Yeah. ,QC,F,SA2 11.25,
B,"So I would say that the introduction must be really, really not brief, but we don't have to dedicate a lot of time too. So I would say that we have to write like an introduction of one page explaining the concepts. Uh, then another, uh, about the methodology we have to explain about Honeycomb and Microsoft Teams, I would say, I would include it there the explanation, like a brief explanation of, I mean that we are going to look to the affordances of Microsoft Teams and whatever, and then there is like the big part, because for the analysis I, I think there are I, I didn't remember how many points. I think there are seven or nine points of Honeycomb.",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"Yes, so 7 or 8 there's, yeah, a something like that. Yeah, something like that. ",QC,,SA2 11.25,
B,"Yeah. So, so that we have to divide it. I didn't know you were here. ",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
V,I know. I just realized it as well.,QC,OT,SA2 11.25,
B,Why did you arrive that late?,ELI,OT,SA2 11.25,
O,Hi A! ,EXT,OT,SA2 11.25,
B,"Oh, no answers. ",EXT,OT,SA2 11.25,
V,Maybe…,EXT,OT,SA2 11.25,
O,Your speaker is off. Helloooo!,EXT,OT,SA2 11.25,
B,"I don't know, but I think we, we should talk and I honestly, we should talk about the importance of this meetings, because if we are not here, it's really difficult to organize the work. Uh, well, I don't know. Let's see if she answers and we can talk.",EXT,,SA2 11.25,
V,"Yeah, so I think we all have to… I mean we know very little about our analysis, so I think we all need this week like when we meet again, we need to have the points like each of us comes with an idea like…",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
B,"Yeah, yeah, but you know, V. The thing is that this way of working is not working. So we, we should like, have homework, homework to do and something to show because if we just say read… ",CON,R,SA2 11.25,
V,Yes. ,QC,R,SA2 11.25,
B,"We see that this is not working, so…",CON,R,SA2 11.25,
V,"Yeah, so let's, let's divide this Honeycomb stuff. Let's divide this.",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
B,"OK, at least, at least if you know you have two tops,  2 topics of the honeycomb you are gonna read about that too and you have to write something about that.",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
A,Yes.,QC,,SA2 11.25,
V,"Let me check, I… Do you have the Padlet somewhere there or somebody here?",ELI,P,SA2 11.25,
B,"Wait, wait, one second!",EXT,P,SA2 11.25,
V,Because in the Padlet is the picture…,EXT,P,SA2 11.25,
B,"Because I have another article opened up. It's in meeting notes, right?",ELI,P,SA2 11.25,
V,"Yeah, OK I have, I have in my screen. This is so hard.",QC,P,SA2 11.25,
B,"If not, I can open it.",QC,,SA2 11.25,
V,Yeah you can. You can try because this is asking if I have permissions. ,QC,,SA2 11.25,
B,"Ok, one second. OK, well I don't know if it's here. It's here, right? OK.  So, the honeycomb is here.",QC,,SA2 11.25,
V,"Yes, exactly. So, we have 1234567, 7 in Social Media Functionality, implications of the functionality… So we have 7 and we are five. OK, so we need to divide this.",EXT,,SA2 11.25,
B,Yeah.,QC,,SA2 11.25,
V,Any preferences?,ELI,,SA2 11.25,
B,"The thing is that you, you, S and me, we also have the methodology and introduction, so I would say that A and O must have more because if not, it's too much work and it's not balanced.",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"True. So, A and O, which one would you like to analyze within Teams?",ELI,F,SA2 11.25,
O,Aaaaahm….,EXT,,SA2 11.25,
A,Emotion (inaudible) personality. ,EXT,,SA2 11.25,
V,"A, we cannot hear you.",EXT,,SA2 11.25,
A,"Now, my voice is…",EXT,,SA2 11.25,
O,So we are going to… What did you say?,ELI,,SA2 11.25,
B,"“Sorry, I cannot hear you.”",EXT,,SA2 11.25,
V,"OK, O, if you want to do, like which ones do you want to? ",ELI,F,SA2 11.25,
O,"OK, so we are going to analyze the seven concepts right?",ELI,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"Yes, we're gonna analyse these concepts in Teams, like for example, sharing - the extent to which users exchange, distribute and receive content. So how do people in Teams share, exchange, view generative content.",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
O,"OK, so sharing. Uh, I don't know about A, but I don't know how much she can do. But I mean, if she can choose a few, I can do the rest. If she can't, I can do everything.",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
B,"No, but the thing is that it is a group work, so you can't do everything, Anikta  also needs to do something.",CON,F,SA2 11.25,
A,"No, no, I am gonna do anything (inaudible). ",CON,F,SA2 11.25,
O,"OK, so I'm gonna do that sharing",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
A,"Or what about, UM? Share A? Are you taking sharing?",ELI,F,SA2 11.25,
O,"Sharing, aaa, presence, relationship, groups and… ",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
V,You can choose 3-3. ,EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
A,"I, I was thinking to take.",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
B,OK. ,QC,F,SA2 11.25,
A,"I was thinking to take a convert-, conversations, groups and the third one is…",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,

A,"OK, then, conversations, presence and reputation.",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"OK, so O, you do have sharing, relationships and groups. ",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
O,Yeah.,QC,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"And A, you have conversation, presence and reputation. Right? ",ELI,F,SA2 11.25,
A,"Yeah, yeah. ",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
B,So there's still…,EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"Yeah, I can take it. ",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
B,"The identity, right?",ELI,F,SA2 11.25,
V,I can take a look at it. We can maybe do it. ,QC,F,SA2 11.25,
B,"OK, anyway, although they are doing this. A and O, although you are doing the analysis is true that this is like the big point of the article. So we will go all through it.",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
V,Yes. ,QC,F,SA2 11.25,
B,"…Through it. Of course it's your part, but we will try to, to read a lot, also because it's like the main point of the article. So… ",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"Yes, exactly. ",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
B,"OK, great",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
A,"OK so I, I just wanted to know, uh. OK, brief article I can understand, but what exactly we are looking into this, I mean the main points if we are taking, supposed conversations, then what exactly we are looking?",ELI,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"But I mean, do you like what, UM? What do you think we're doing in this research? Do you know what is our question? Our research question?",ELI,F,SA2 11.25,
A,"Yeah, that, that I can understand. But uh, how brief it is, that is the question. I mean how brief we have to explain everything.",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"No, no brief, not brief. Just go ahead, go…",CON,F,SA2 11.25,
B,"You, you should write as much as you can because your point is the analysis. So is the biggest part of the article. So try to, to read about Microsoft Teams. Try to read about the meaning of, for example, you have reputation. Although in the honeycomb they give you an explanation of reputation you can look for a definition of reputation. You can see how reputation is in Microsoft Teams, you have to write.",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
V,Research and write.,EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
A,"OK, ok, got it. ",QC,F,SA2 11.25,

V,"Yeah, I, I think that… ",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
A,"Yeah, got it. ",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"That S will create the document. We didn't agree, but I think maybe we can just send a text. He will create the document and we have to get hands on and start writing. Like not, not about, I'm gonna write about this… No, we, we, we, we write, like. ",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
B,Yes. ,QC,F,SA2 11.25,
A,Yes. ,QC,F,SA2 11.25,
O,"Yeah and I think it's important we write on a central file as you write. Even if you have a, a different file you’re writing on something. Like you're using your MS Word to write, as much as you write to, post it so that it can be visible to everybody. Every other person, who I mean by the someone like me. I think when I open the file and I see that this person has gone this far and all of that it's somehow encourages me to sit up and do more or less, like… I mean, I can see that people are already working and they are, they are on it already so, I think it would be better we post that and we know what, who, this one person has done and the next thing to do and all of that.",QC,P,SA2 11.25,
V,"Yes, that's why we have the shared document. So we all write in the same space. I see what you guys write, you see what I write.",INT,P,SA2 11.25,
O,Yeah.,QC,,SA2 11.25,
B,"Yes, yes. ",QC,,SA2 11.25,

A,On Padlet? ,ELI,,SA2 11.25,
O,"I know, we know it's, it's I mean we drop comments in, in a, in a shared file in a in Microsoft Teams. So when you happen to maybe read through or you see something you need to talk about in someone’s part, you can easily drop a comment for the person, but the person visits the file again. She or she can easily start making some amendments from it. For instance, If what A is writing on same reputation is not actually connecting to what we really expect simply because maybe she does not understand the whole concept and everything we could highlight parts and then drop a comment for her. I think by that she visits the file next time, she picks up and does something.",EXT,P,SA2 11.25,

I know I'm like all the time saying that, but we need to work hard and we need to be connected and we need to talk. So, please, for example, today A is fine, you join later but, if you are joining later, you must say to the others, because we, we need to know what is going on, OK? Yeah, so please let me….",QC,P,SA2 11.25,

V,"Like we have the Padlet, we have the online document and, and I feel like the only ones that we’re putting stuff is B and S, so. Like we need to start, you know, interacting online with the platforms, we still need to go to Padlet see, I shared some documents, some researchers like that I've been reading, so I think that you know. We need to open each other’s files, see what B is  thinking, see what S’s thinking… So, we actually, you know, we haven't had a meeting that we are fully the five of us together, so it's kind of weird. I feel like we've been…",EXT,P,SA2 11.25,
B,Yes. ,QC,P,SA2 11.25,
V,"… dragging some stuff, so I think we need to be fully hands on now and just like go. So I, I feel like for the next meeting, we need to have you know, present our work like taking like seriously that, you know?",ELI,P,SA2 11.25,
B,Yes.,QC,P,SA2 11.25,

A,"Yeah, actually the problem is like, this is also in Germany. There is a 4, 4:00 o'clock but now it is in a 10:30 in India. So, the problem is time difference. That's the reason most of the time I'm not available.",EXT,P,SA2 11.25,

B,"… at this time and we will manage to find a time. But it's important to talk because we don't know what is happening and we, we need to work. There's five of us. Because it's true that these past weeks, we feel that we didn't work at the same level and right now we need to work the five of us with the same, you know, power because we need to finish on time.

O,"I also think from today that your present now at the end of the meeting. By the time the meeting decision is being made, you can state your own fact like, OK, by this time it's gonna be 1.00 AM in my country. So, we could as much as possible try to adjust the time to suit everybody so you don't have to wake up in the middle of the night to join a meeting.",EXT,,SA2 11.25,
V,Mhm. ,QC,,SA2 11.25,
O,"and then again when it has to do with working on the file,  I mean from your side you can work at any time, you should choose to. ",EXT,,SA2 11.25,
V,Yeah. ,QC,,SA2 11.25,
O,It's just about the meeting. ,EXT,,SA2 11.25,
V,"Yes, exactly O. Exactly what she said, like on your time, you can work whatever, so we let… Related to that. Let's come up with one or two ideas for when to meet tomorrow. Eh, tomorrow, am next week.",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
B,"Hm, next week. ",QC,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"So, we can give S like OK, one or the other one.",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,
B,"Yeah.  For me, UM, at anytime at Tuesday it's working. But I will say Tuesday, it's too, too early for me because this weekend I can't, I'm not here, so, I would say we can meet… Why don't we meet for example on, on Friday?",ELI,F,SA2 11.25,
V,"Yeah, Friday, I will be up until three, I think, yeah, I, I can, I can do it on Friday.",QC,F,SA2 11.25,

A,"Yeah, Friday is OK, but at what time? OK. ",ELI,F,SA2 11.25,
V,So (inaudible)…late?,ELI,F,SA2 11.25,
B,… works better for you because you are the one that has different hours? ,ELI,F,SA2 11.25,
V,Mhm. ,QC,F,SA2 11.25,
B,What German time works for you?,ELI,F,SA2 11.25,

A,Yeah. ,QC,F,SA2 11.25,

O,… or something. ,EXT,P,SA2 11.25,

A,Meeting notes.,EXT,P,SA2 11.25,

A,OK.,QC,P,SA2 11.25,
O,"A anything you, you drop it in the file and by the next video, writing you will check if there is a comment attached to what you've written already. So, if someone goes to your part and eventually finds something, the person will drop for you a comment, attach to your part of the work, so you read up and do the necessary thing.",EXT,F,SA2 11.25,

O,Yeah. ,QC,OT,SA2 11.25,
V,Bye.,EXT,OT,SA2 11.25,
V,"All right people. I feel, can I say something? I feel S you would like to give it another try that we've been working right. Am I right?",ELI,,SA2 12.03,
B,"Someone mute him. Well, I think it's only a microphone, I can… OK, thank you.",EXT,,SA2 12.03,
V,"Uhm, uh, I think S you would like to, you know, correct me, if I'm wrong. I'm trying to understand what you guys think. Uh, to that you would like to like give it another try to kind of continue the how we've been working before and to try to do it still collaboratively, collaboratively, uh, in that sense? Uh personally, I must say I, I can do whatever you guys want. You guys, I, I was planning to tell you that next, next week I am flying to Argentina so Tuesday and Wednesday I'm gonna be off. However, I've been looking at 2 aspects of of the honeycomb in Teams which are conversations and and identity that I could potentially wright about that. I could, I like conversations particularly and I can, and think about that especially bringing asynchronous and, and these different kind of possibilities that Teams bring.",ELI,,SA2 12.03,
B,Yeah.,QC,,SA2 12.03,
V,"But you guys, what you want?",ELI,F,SA2 12.03,
B,"Maybe we can follow Sabrine program, but in- instead of writing each person about 5 aspects, we can write about 3 or 4. We don't need to write about 5 aspects like, I would say right?",ELI,F,SA2 12.03,
V,"No, but we don't, we, I mean, each of us is one.",CON,F,SA2 12.03,
B,"OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, sorry I understood another thing.",QC,,SA2 12.03,
V,"I think, Sabrine, correct me guys if I'm being wrong, Sabrine said, one aspect of the Honeycomb each.",ELI,,SA2 12.03,
O,"In my opinion, I think getting to understand what we really want to work on, is the problem. Like right now, B’s understanding that we all work on 5, 5 aspects. Meanwhile from what Sabrine  (inaudible) to say, I understand that each (inaudible)  fix one aspect of the honeycomb and work on. So, I mean, I think this was just the same mistake that made us not understand what we can finalize on last week. So for me, I think from that already still in line, we could just pick 1 aspect of the Honeycomb. They said only and only, uhm to me somehow, see the lines and, like, I had earlier said, if I come across something which I think is I, I know literature is very difficult to find in this. So if I come across something, I think it's important for every other parts of aspect of the stuff that is necessary to everyone else in the group. I could share and I think by this we can do it and do it better and faster. So right now, suggest maybe we choose 5 aspects of the Honeycomb, the one we think we can easily lay hands on materials for, and we already share it 1 by 1. Like, I already wrote in the chat, I had written that I would like to work on the communication aspect of the of this thing, but I don't know if anyone read that actually. So should we just maybe share the honeycomb. Someone should share the screen and we pick five aspects that would like to work on.",EXT,F,SA2 12.03,
V,"OK and then we, we write specifically what we have to write for each of them. So what's happening then, I agree O. We can do that.",QC,F,SA2 12.03,
B,"Yes, OK, that's fine. And I would say that we should really have it done for Monday because we don't have time and if we have to join everything. Then I would say that on Monday it should be written.",QC,F,SA2 12.03,
V,I agree.,QC,F,SA2 12.03,
V,"I have to do it before. I would do it today as a matter of fact, because…",EXT,F,SA2 12.03,
O,"Monday… Monday, I don't think I would be able to finish by Monday or I'll be joining the meeting because I mean, I have to say this now. My hospital stopped, but continues, on Monday by 8 AM I'll be in the hospital. Sometimes you get concluded by maybe 4 PM or something. It's right now what I'm undergoing is a dental procedure and it depends on when the doctor is done with me. So, I have an appointment for Monday and I've already get to the hospital at 8 AM and I mean,  as at yesterday I go back around 5 PM so sometimes it can be very challenging and I mean like a human being,  I come back with the pain and tiredness and everything, so…",EXT,F,SA2 12.03,
V,"Hm, of course O.",QC,F,SA2 12.03,
O,"I don't know, Monday or…",EXT,F,SA2 12.03,
V,"Of course, but we have to remember that by Sunday next week, it needs to be done, so… You know we have a week. Maybe, maybe, you could work on the weekend before you go to the next appointment.",CON,F,SA2 12.03,
O,"Uhm, for the weekend I have assignments like three of them that the deadline is Sunday evening …",EXT,F,SA2 12.03,
B,"Yeah, but this assignment is really important, O, we don't have time.",QC,F,SA2 12.03,
V,"OK, O, when, when can you submit it? When can you do your work? I can do it when I get back from the hospital on Monday and maybe on, on, on Tuesday. Tuesday.",ELI,F,SA2 12.03,
O,"I can do it when I get back from the hospital on Monday (inaudiblle) and maybe can share it on, on, on Tuesday. ",EXT,F,SA2 12.03,
V,"OK, Tuesday is your final deadline that you can do it.",QC,F,SA2 12.03,
O,Yes.,QC,F,SA2 12.03,
V,"OK, let's let's, let's focus now first on the on the honeycomb. Thank you, S, for sharing it. And as I said, I've been focusing already on conversations, but if somebody wants it, as I said, I will be….",EXT,P,SA2 12.03,
B,Can I take relationships?,ELI,,SA2 12.03,
V,Fine by me.,QC,,SA2 12.03,
O,"Uhm, I don't know.",EXT,,SA2 12.03,
A,"(inaudible). Yeah, I, I wanted to take sharing.",QC,,SA2 12.03,
V,"Sharing? OK, Conversation, Sharing, Relationship, S, any…?",ELI,,SA2 12.03,
O,"I think we have to, uh, do we have to 1st pick the first five we want? Or can anyone just choose until we choose five? I like, I already wrote. I'd want to go with conversation, so I don't know.",ELI,,SA2 12.03,
V,"OK, uh, you can have it if you want. I mean, I don't know. I haven't read, I, I don't see. I didn't see what you actually wrote in conversation. If you want to have it, you can have it.",QC,,SA2 12.03,
O,"But if that, if that, you can work on them, it's fine. I could look for another, but I mean that's already where I had started researching on, because like, I and A shared last time, I, I that was the first I picked, so I was beginning to, to get a few things. And so, just maybe I continue with it and.",CON,,SA2 12.03,
S,"Yeah, sorry. I was zoning out.",EXT,,SA2 12.03,
B,"No worries. I think it was me. Relationships, yeah?",ELI,,SA2 12.03,
S,"B, you said relationships?",ELI,,SA2 12.03,
B,Yes.,QC,,SA2 12.03,
S,"A, what aspect did you say?",ELI,,SA2 12.03,
A,Sharing.,EXT,,SA2 12.03,
S,Coolio.,QC,,SA2 12.03,
V,"I can, maybe I mean, S, what do you think it was the most important? Can you go a little bit up? The extent to which that his presence, ahhhm.",ELI,,SA2 12.03,
S,"Sorry V, question?",ELI,,SA2 12.03,
V,"Yeah, no. Can you go a little bit up so we can see the whole chart?",ELI,,SA2 12.03,
S,"It's someone else sharing, Sir.",EXT,,SA2 12.03,
V,"Oh, sorry, I'm sorry, I thought that it was you.",EXT,,SA2 12.03,
B,"No, it’s me.",CON,,SA2 12.03,
V,"Oh, sorry. Uhm… Because we have, OK, we have sharing - A, conversations, relationship so we have less, S. Basically, you and me we have to choose one.",EXT,,SA2 12.03,
B,I would say Presence and Identity are important.,EXT,,SA2 12.03,
V,"Yeah, I, I didn't think, I was, looking at it and it's messy.",CON,,SA2 12.03,
B,"OK, OK.",QC,,SA2 12.03,
V,"It's, it's, aaaa I don't know. And maybe, maybe, maybe I can take Presence. Between the others that are available there… What do you think is the most important? I mean Presence, this has to be there, right?",ELI,,SA2 12.03,
B,Yes.,QC,,SA2 12.03,
V,"I don't know, I'm thinking.",CON,,SA2 12.03,
A,I think Groups are important aspect…,EXT,,SA2 12.03,
V,"Groups, as well, S, what do you want to take? What would you like?",ELI,,SA2 12.03,
S,I'm easy. You know…,EXT,,SA2 12.03,
V,"But, but we cannot...",CON,,SA2 12.03,
S,"What I want is secondary to what is needed for, for this work and, so you're like, enjoy, like sorry like enjoyment assessment. My enjoyment here was less about our group, it's just like, sorry I just don't like that assignment, that it's not even, FYI, like…",EXT,,SA2 12.03,
B,"Me neither, so I understand you.",QC,,SA2 12.03,
S,"Yes. So, like you girls are all fine all nice, nice to communicate with, so, so it's just about getting this done.",EXT,,SA2 12.03,
B,"Yeah, I agree.",QC,,SA2 12.03,
S,Identity is messy. I agree…,QC,,SA2 12.03,
B,"In groups you can talk about channels, about like… Oh, I have an idea. OK, let me, let me have, can I have groups? Because, I'm thinking, in groups you, can talk about learning communities, you can talk about sharing interest and I think I have information about this that can be interesting. So, maybe, I have things for that.",ELI,,SA2 12.03,
V,"Good, yeah, that's good and I like that idea. Yeah, as I said, I wouldn't choose identity because it's, “extent to which users reveal them”, it's, it's, it's… I don't think we can, I don't know. I'm not very convinced about it. I'm not gonna, perhaps even tell why, but I would much rather go for presence or…",QC,,SA2 12.03,
B," Or relationships, I left relationships. You can take it, if you want.",ELI,,SA2 12.03,
V,"Oh you left it, it's free to catch.",EXT,,SA2 12.03,
V,"No, no, no I don't, I, I would like, I would think, I could talk about Presence - the extent to which users know if others are available. You know, the sharing documents, the I can see when people are online and you know…. Yeah, there is some gadgets of Microsoft Teams that I could… Could be related to that…",CON,,SA2 12.03,
B,Mhm.,QC,,SA2 12.03,
S,"Mhm. So just because, we're at a point where, to be honest, we could take a different framework. This was some good food for thought. Now, I'm not joking. Once I did that research, uh, yesterday, like, OK, we have the honeycomb now, we've discussed the aspect. They're freshmen minds, but now look at this different way of looking at it again.",EXT,F,SA2 12.03,
B,"Should it be here, because I cannot see it here? Yeah, great.",ELI,,SA2 12.03,
V,Uuuu.,EXT,,SA2 12.03,
S,"And as, just like to throw it in there:  Accessibility, Bandwidth - she's tricky, Social Presence. Privacy, Networks Association, Personalization, Persistence and its ability, Conversation control,  Anonymity.",EXT,,SA2 12.03,
B,"Yeah, I would honestly keep on with Honeycomb. I feel we don't have a lot of time to change a lot and…",CON,F,SA2 12.03,
S,"I'm just saying that at this point, uh, if we wanted to, uh, it would be the least.  At this very point would take the least amount of effort. Because to be honest, I just like this is a nice construct, but I just found two separate research, research studies that, or at least more consistent…",CON,F,SA2 12.03,
V,Mhm…,QC,,SA2 12.03,
S,"But, but but I see vague, vague definition of social affordances by at least three sources. Why?",CON,,SA2 12.03,
V,"I was actually planning on using the one that you put, from the one that you were just showing the affordances and the examples because that is very practical. And, and, I was, you know, thinking of including that even on the use of using the honeycomb. I don't think you know it's exclusive. One to another. What do you think?",INT,F,SA2 12.03,
B,What do you mean I? I didn't understand what you are saying…,ELI,,SA2 12.03,
V,"That we can still use it. I mean, we can for example, if we continue with honeycomb, let's say and then. But we can use all the sources that…",INT,F,SA2 12.03,
B,Yeah…,QC,F,SA2 12.03,
V,"you know the the honeycomb has really BIG categories, so I think the ones that you propose S are narrowing it down. It's more practical, more simple, more clear, so we can still use them, I think.",INT,F,SA2 12.03,
B,"Yeah, yeah. In fact, in my case that my point is groups. I will make reference to the definition that appears in honeycomb, but then I will look for a other definitions where they are relating groups with learning communities. So it's like you see, I'm not only referring to honeycomb, I will try to open it a bit more, because if I'm talking about learning communities, it's very easy to talk about the channels in teams. Then how you can join. A course that it's about one topic. How you can join like a community. I would go in that direction. I think.",EXT,F,SA2 12.03,
V,Yep.,QC,F,SA2 12.03,
S,"All right. And we can agree… Then to be honest, it has been a long meeting and my mind, my head's not working straight. But Marija's idea to write up just an outline on exactly how we're gonna do it… works.",EXT,P,SA2 12.03,
V,"Yeah, I'm writing here in the in the meeting notes. I'm saying: Read Sabrine document related to guidelines before we start writing. First of all, write about how we selected the article. Second, presenting the honeycomb element, the definition.”  You guys agree?",ELI,P,SA2 12.03,
S,"Honeycomb, she mentioned should be included in the introduction.",CON,P,SA2 12.03,
B,Yeah.,QC,P,SA2 12.03,
V,"Yeah, I mean, I mean yeah. I mean just presenting for example B has groups, so she presents the definition of groups and she's like starts by building from there, like, definition. And then how is related to Teams. So we all kind of have the same structure of things. We selected the articles - how we select the articles; then we present the specific gadget of, of honeycomb. He finish and, and then how it applies to tune to teams. It, it's my suggestion. Just guys, you know, feel free…",INT,P,SA2 12.03,
A,"OK, OK So what are you trying to say, For each aspect, I, we have to select the article and why we are selecting the honeycomb. We have to describe it for each aspect, right?",ELI,P,SA2 12.03,
B,Yes.,QC,P,SA2 12.03,
A,OK. Clear.,QC,P,SA2 12.03,

V,"I use Eric and this uh, and database and I use I put words for example. For example, social affordances in this, I don't know how to say in English and then I put, yeah, I put “AND” something else.

How about you guys?",EXT,,SA2 12.03,
B,"Also using databases I don't remember right now the name, but like, ResearchGate, Scopolus.",INT,,SA2 12.03,

S,Different points of view. We're taking this one.,EXT,,SA2 12.03,
V,Mhm.,QC,,SA2 12.03,
S,"So yeah, so tech-, so once we officially write, we consider the seven Council of the Honeycomb as social affordance. In this study from then on, we can call them social affordances.",INT,,SA2 12.03,
V,"Social affordances. Yeah, I think so, too. Maybe, I'm thinking, maybe S, uhm, can you maybe do that part of the introduction I left the part where I was, I was thinking of writing it, but do you want to write a … you. If you want to do that?",ELI,F,SA2 12.03,
S,"Yes, as my whole part is, just as I put it at the back, because yeah, I still waiting to update, to polish it, so I could join it to your introduction. 'cause really the framework is gonna.",QC,F,SA2 12.03,
B,Yeah.,QC,,SA2 12.03,
S,"The last point, once we elaborate on the three main constructs of a social presence, social presence, sociability, which is made up of different affordances…",EXT,,SA2 12.03,
V,Mhm.,QC,,SA2 12.03,
S,"…then we introduce the framework as one way, one, one framework that gives us the specific constructs for four days, which is otherwise a vague term.",EXT,,SA2 12.03,
V,"Yeah, I think that's great.  OK, so then I get, I get…",QC,,SA2 12.03,
B,I was gonna say…,EXT,,SA2 12.03,
V,I leave it to you.,EXT,,SA2 12.03,
B,"I was gonna say that maybe in methodology, we can just reference the databases we are using, the keywords we are using, like why are we choosing these articles, like we read the titles on the abstracts and we found that articles. But instead, and, and I would include the part of Honeycomb in the everything of that in the introduction, instead of in the method.",CON,P,SA2 12.03,
V,"Yes, yes, I think what Ss said as well.",QC,P,SA2 12.03,
B,"I, I was checking.",CON,P,SA2 12.03,
V,"Great and I'm thinking also that the methodology will come naturally at the end when we finish this, right, about how we selected the articles.",QC,,SA2 12.03,
B,"Yes, but that part….",CON,,SA2 12.03,
V,"This, I think will be our main part of the methodology. You know it will come naturally about what we, what databases we used actually.",EXT,,SA2 12.03,
B,"Yes, but that's, that's important to write it because you can forget",CON,,SA2 12.03,
V,"Yeah, yes, yes, yes, that yeah, we have to write every note. These are, like, kind of mandatory. Sort of like we don't have to forget of each point here. It's not something that we choose this or that, they have, you know there has to be there. And I think the only thing less is like a results conclusion. Kind of in summing up.",INT,,SA2 12.03,
B,Ok.,QC,,SA2 12.03,
V,"Team has this affordances, could be better than this, could be…",EXT,,SA2 12.03,
B,"So, we say are there enough affordances for that element.",EXT,P,SA2 12.03,
V,"Oh, yeah, social affordance. Yeah, it is good.",QC,P,SA2 12.03,
B,"Could other ones be used. Uhm, maybe you can… No, I was thinking about comparing. Maybe…",CON,P,SA2 12.03,
V,"No, no.",CON,P,SA2 12.03,
B,"No, it is too much.",CON,P,SA2 12.03,
V,"The results, feel free, I think that we need to go crazy in here like, you know, be critical in what we found on Teams, that's what we didn't find, what we know from other platforms, let's say if we know anything, you know, it's fair to use our experience and expertise using this thing. This past year we, all students, we have all, we used many I guess, so we can…",EXT,P,SA2 12.03,
B,Yeah.,QC,P,SA2 12.03,
V,Maybe. Do it.,QC,P,SA2 12.03,
B,Yeah.,QC,P,SA2 12.03,
V,"I think this is, is it?",ELI,R,SA2 12.03,
B,"I think that's all, yeah.",QC,R,SA2 12.03,
S,"Once the first person who starts a, searching for, doing the research for the construct, send a message with the databases. Because once we put it all together, you know, the quicker we agree on which databases we use, the easy will be just to merge it…",EXT,F,SA2 12.03,
V,Merge it.,EXT,F,SA2 12.03,
S,And make it look like a more consistent work.,EXT,F,SA2 12.03,
B,Yeah.,QC,F,SA2 12.03,
V,"And yeah, maybe if you S, S maybe you guys know which one is the more reliable. I'm still learning and personally I wouldn't know which one is, you know the strongest but maybe if S you know that, you know that some database has been reliable and has been working for you over the past years, we can use that.",ELI,F,SA2 12.03,
S,"It's like Sabrina says, social sciences, and unfortunately, social science is no an engine.",EXT,,SA2 12.03,
V,"It will, yeah.",QC,,SA2 12.03,
B,"Guys, it's not that easy. But anyway, for example in my case, when I wrote my TFG, like my final dissertation, uh, I did like a systematic review about creativity and I used many platforms. Actually, I use it, like, plenty of them because I needed like to have all the articles there. So, I would say it even depends on the topic. There are some…",CON,,SA2 12.03,
B,"And, and databases that are better for some topics than for other ones. So, I would say yes, let's try to see and if we find that there is one that have most of the things we need, let's go directly for that one.",CON,F,SA2 12.03,
V,"OK, OK, good, thank you guys.",QC,,SA2 12.03,
B,"And one thing, let's…",EXT,,SA2 12.03,
V,Yeah.,QC,,SA2 12.03,
B,"One thing, uh, let's try to talk more about what we are doing. OK?",EXT,P,SA2 12.03,
V,Mhm.,QC,P,SA2 12.03,
B,Because I think this is something that we should all do.,EXT,P,SA2 12.03,

B,Yeah.,QC,F,SA2 12.03,
V,"So, I mean and we still have like after, like this is not ending, like, well after we write, we still need to come together write the abstract, the keywords and put our work together. So, we need more time for that. So, I wouldn't say, to, you know, extend this deadline for writing too long. But, what do you think?",ELI,F,SA2 12.03,
B,"No, no, no. I would say Monday because according to Marija , on the 13th we need to give this a draft to another group to evaluate it and then we will receive the draft, all of the other people to see, to evaluate it. So, I would say we don't have much more.",CON,F,SA2 12.03,

V,"So, O, do you agree?",ELI,F,SA2 12.03,
O,"Oh… So are we? I honestly do not really understand this. Yeah, because at some point I was disconnected entirely, so… Is this different from a, the part of the honeycomb we are working on?",ELI,F,SA2 12.03,
B,"No, Nino, it's the same. I mean, we divide the pieces of the honeycomb as we said, and now we wrote here this test we have to follow this weekend to write about a topic. So, you have to go to one of these databases, you have to write the keywords, database, you have to write the definition of the element you are looking for, you have to see what social affordances has Microsoft Teams related to your element and write the results like (inaudible) honeycomb. And we are saying if we can meet on Monday at 4, 12PM.",CON,F,SA2 12.03,
O,"I like, I had said earlier. I mean, uhm, earlier in the meeting it was like, I did, I said, it came as emergency so I had earlier said, I have an appointment at 4, 8, 8AM Monday and the process takes and…",EXT,F,SA2 12.03,
B,But.,CON,F,SA2 12.03,

V,"Maybe, maybe not the meeting, maybe not meeting, just having it written down.",EXT,F,SA2 12.03,
B,Exactly.,QC,F,SA2 12.03,
V,"Having it written down by 4:00 o'clock on Monday, so everybody can do it whenever you want, and then we meet.",EXT,F,SA2 12.03,

V,yeah.,QC,,SA2 12.03,
O,"OK, so uh, like I said, I,  I will be working on getting my assignments that are due for weekend, from today to Sunday. If I happen to finish on time on Sunday, I'll conclude it before I go to the hospital, but if I don't then when I get back from hospital I will be able to finish it before Tuesday and maybe upload it by Tuesday.",CON,,SA2 12.03,
B,"No, but, I honestly I understand that you have assignments, but really this has to be done. On Monday is the deadline because we don't have time, we have to work then on joining every party running the conclusions and the abstract. So I don't know how you can do it, maybe you have to get up earlier, but we need it on Monday.",CON,F,SA2 12.03,
V,"Maybe yeah, as we said, not the meeting, just writing it down. It's, it's, it's. I'm sure you won't take too much time if you have already been working on your part so that you had already some articles and conversations, so I don't think it would be too much time.",CON,F,SA2 12.03,
A,"Let's do our part on Monday and if she can, she, uh, she can complete it on Monday, It's, it's better, but if she, if she can't, then… Because you're negotiating all here, a telling to her, like, it's not working if she want to do that, she will do that. We cannot force her like that.",CON,F,SA2 12.03,
B,We are not forcing! The thing is that we don't have time…,CON,,SA2 12.03,

B,"Go ahead, so Monday evening.",QC,F,SA2 12.03,
V,"And yeah, just as as we said, no meeting, just writing it down, just, you know. But anyway, we don't, we don't stress about it, just you know, if you find something, If I find, if you find an article that you think it might help me or I find an article that might help you, share, we talk, we have a WhatsApp group we have here so, you know we can have a bit more smoothly over the weekend.",EXT,F,SA2 12.03,
B,OK.,QC,F,SA2 12.03,
O,"At this point I honestly do not want to misunderstand anything at all. So that, I mean we don't have this issue again because there is no time. PLEASE, I am sorry for my connection which keep interrupting, but please can somebody be kind enough to EXPLAIN to me what will have to do on Monday? I mean the screen has been shared, yes, does it mean we are going to have to finish everything about the each concept we pick and there's (inaudible) on Teams by Monday. Is that what it means?",ELI,F,SA2 12.03,
V,"Exactly. We have divided each aspect of the honeycomb among ourselves, and each of us are responsible of presenting it into the, the work. So, O has Conversations, A Sharing,  B Groups, V Presence, S Relationships or whatever you want of the rest, and maybe we can talk about it too. So basically, you have to, to select an article, explain how you came to that article, which database did you use and then you have to present the element of the honeycomb. You have O a Conversations, so you have to present, perhaps give a definition about it, it related to, to, to what you find in the scientific articles and related like to Microsoft Team’. How is it present in Microsoft Team. Do you understand?",INT,F,SA2 12.03,
O,"Yes, but the part I do not understand is select an article and write about how we come to the article. That's the confusing part for me.",CON,,SA2 12.03,
V,"Maybe you guys, I tried to explain it and it didn't work, so maybe you guys…?",ELI,,SA2 12.03,
B,"Can you repeat O, please?",ELI,,SA2 12.03,
O,"The part, the first part of selecting an article and explaining how we selected the article is what I done on this.",EXT,,SA2 12.03,
B,"Yes, when you are looking for an article, you have to go to a database, to every – Research Gate or Scopus, some database where you can find the article and there you have to write the keywords of what you’re looking for. For example, your topic is Conversations. So you will look for Conversation or social affordances or… And then you will find your article.",EXT,,SA2 12.03,
V,Mhm.,QC,,SA2 12.03,
B,So you have to write HOW you find the articles you are reading. You have to speak.,EXT,,SA2 12.03,

B,"Yeah, we have to.",QC,,SA2 12.03,
V,"Subrine, needs it, Subrine just said.",EXT,,SA2 12.03,
O,Ah! Oh my God!,EXT,,SA2 12.03,
V,"And I want to just make a final comment. You can, you know, get some information for your own knowledge from Wikipedia and you know, and other websites. However, WE CANNOT COPY PASTE! And focus on scientific research articles for the definitions and for almost what you write. Please, no websites! Like if you want you can do it for yourself because I do, I go to websites and I try to find clarity because, I'm not gonna lie, I do go to websites, and I just check for definitions because it's simpler. The information is explained simpler in terms but, but then use, please use reliable sources.",CON,,SA2 12.03,
B,"Yes, yes, you guys, I have to leave. I have a strong headache and I, I cannot hear anymore. So we, we are all agreed that on Monday evening all the information should be there, OK? OK, if there is something that is not clear during this weekend, while, while we are working just ask in WhatsApp group. We will talk again. We can talk in the WhatsApp group. We can discuss everything. And I think if we work all on this, it can work, but let's work on that.",EXT,F,SA2 12.03,

V,"So then we would have the methodology kind of ready. I have one question though. Because in we all kind of particularly with my part like presence is not social present. So I had to dedicate, you know a paragraph explaining this issue you know and explaining kind of, and then, you know, Sabrina told me, this is not what it's supposed to be. You have to describe this in the introduction when you describe the honeycomb. I honestly don't think that we have to do that. I wouldn't like to explain each part of the honeycomb framework within the introduction. 
But this is up to you guys because I know this is not what she wanted, but I don't think this is not what I wanted either. I feel like I have to explain it in presence.

S&B,"(Noding and pointing, B wants to say something)",QC,P,SA2 12.07,

Then of course, literature search limit live, not all databases. Then other limitations.",EXT,,SA2 12.07,

V,"Yeah, and A, can I say something to you? Just I I I think that you did a great job in your part. And the the only thing on the methods. If you can write their research terms, a step did and B did, and I did. So we all kind of have the same. Could you do that so we have kind of the same structure of methods?",ELI,F,SA2 12.07,
A,"Okay, so in the method, I have to mention parts, right? which we all did, okay?",ELI,F,SA2 12.07,
B,"You have to mention the words you wrote to find the articles. For example, you wrote Microsoft Teams, you wrote affordances. You wrote all this.",EXT,F,SA2 12.07,

I think I'm gonna highlight with another color the part that I want to include the conclusions. So I think it's going to be easier to to see what everyone wants in the conclusions from each part, and then we can rewrite everything, but it's going to be easier to go directly to the highlighted in colors than to read everything again.

And just, you know, feel free to write and to contribute and then we can come. At the end for you know, make like a strong conclusion of this is what we think overall.

B,"I would say methods and then no, because I would I I was going to say results and then each each one of the five. And then, honeycomb (inaudible), but it's not the thing, but because we have to include the the names of the methodology of each of each one. So maybe it's not the best way to organize it.

S,Go ahead.,EXT,,SA2 12.13,
B,"And I'm, I just don't understand because uh, A put Microsoft Teams or shared and Microsoft Teams or share and Microsoft Teams or MS Teams. This is because they they create the terms after doing the search and they don't remember and they tried to do something there, you know, because when you write the terms after doing the research, you know what terms you used.

B,Yeah,QC,,SA2 12.13,
V,"When you, when you wrote um group for example, you use this ""asterisko"", uh, groups, groups or whatever, all the endings. But you also used these things. I don't know how they call in English.

V,Mhm.,QC,,SA2 12.13,
B,"And also this part, it's super long comparing to the other ones and there are no references, so Umm.",EXT,P,SA2 12.13,

B,Mhm,QC,,SA2 12.13,

B,Yeah,QC,P,SA2 12.13,

B,"I would, I don't know. I I would include for example the definition of the of The Honeycomb there, because it's just a sentence, we already have it and I think it would make like everything more clear. And I would really love to to edit it, but I think it's not fair. So I would leave it like that, actually.",EXT,,SA2 12.13,
V,"Okay so we add the definition, that's it.",QC,,SA2 12.13,
S,"Ohh yeah. Because since we are receiving individual assessment, then for the observer, for the observers, that's what you get when you take away group accountability",EXT,,SA2 12.13,

Which it was. Whatever. Let's leave it like that. Let's add some part and that's it. Let's add the definition. And leave it like it is.",EXT,P,SA2 12.13,

S,"I wasn't listening, but if it's yeah, word for word. Well, basically if you put in quotation mark then.",EXT,,SA2 12.13,
