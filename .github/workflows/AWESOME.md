#### Enforce Contribution Guidelines in Pull Requests

**Repository:** [jasmeetsb/gemini-github-actions](https://github.com/jasmeetsb/gemini-github-actions)

**Description:** Automates validation of pull requests against your repository's CONTRIBUTING.md using the Google Gemini CLI. The workflow posts a single upserted PR comment indicating PASS/FAIL with a concise checklist of actionable items, and can optionally fail the job to enforce compliance.

**Key Features:**

- Reads and evaluates PR title, body, and diff against CONTRIBUTING.md
- Posts a single PR comment with a visible PASS/FAIL marker in Comment Title and details of compliance status in the comment body
- Optional enforcement: fail the workflow when violations are detected

**Setup Requirements:**

- Copy [.github/workflows/pr-contribution-guidelines-enforcement.yml](https://github.com/jasmeetsb/gemini-github-actions/blob/main/.github/workflows/pr-contribution-guidelines-enforcement.yml) to your .github/workflows/ folder.
- File: `CONTRIBUTING.md` at the repository root
- (Optional) Repository variable `FAIL_ON_GUIDELINE_VIOLATIONS=true` to fail the workflow on violations

**Example Usage:**

- Define contribution guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md file
- Open a new PR or update an existing PR, which would then trigger the workflow
- Workflow will validate the PR against the contribution guidelines and add a comment in the PR with PASS/FAIL status and details of guideline compliance and non-compliance

  **OR**

- Add following comment in an existing PR **"/validate-contribution"** to trigger the workflow

**Workflow File:**

- Example location in this repo: [.github/workflows/pr-contribution-guidelines-enforcement.yml](https://github.com/jasmeetsb/gemini-github-actions/blob/main/.github/workflows/pr-contribution-guidelines-enforcement.yml)
- Typical usage in a consumer repo: `.github/workflows/pr-contribution-guidelines-enforcement.yml` (copy the file and adjust settings/secrets as needed)
